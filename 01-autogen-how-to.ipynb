    "## Agents Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen introduces conversable agents designed for task-solving through inter-agent dialogue. Key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conversable**: Agents can initiate and continue conversations with others.\n",
    "- **Customizable**: Integration of LLMs, humans, tools, or combinations thereof is supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen includes a `ConversableAgent` class for agents that communicate to complete tasks. Agents vary in their actions upon receiving messages. Notably:\n",
    "- `AssistantAgent` acts as an AI assistant, primarily using LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to generate Python code for tasks described in messages. It can suggest corrections post-execution. Customization is possible via system messages and LLM configuration (`llm_config`).\n",
    "- `UserProxyAgent` represents human users, defaulting to soliciting human input but capable of executing code and using tools. It can automatically execute code blocks from messages if no human input is provided, with the option to disable this feature. LLM-based responses can be enabled with `llm_config`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents' auto-reply feature promotes autonomous communication while allowing for human input. Extension is straightforward with the `register_reply()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup includes creating an `AssistantAgent` named \"assistant\" and a `UserProxyAgent` named \"user_proxy\" to facilitate task-solving."

      "#### Study Design\n",
      "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Participants\n",
      "500 patients aged 40-75 with clinically diagnosed heart disease were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or other severe systemic illnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Randomization and Blinding\n",
      "Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CardioX (100 mg daily) or a matching placebo. Randomization was computer-generated, and both participants and researchers were blinded to the group assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Interventions\n",
      "CardioX or placebo was administered orally once daily for 12 months. Adherence to treatment was assessed through pill counts, patient diaries, and electronic monitoring systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Outcome Measures\n",
      "Primary outcomes included changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and levels of biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). The rationale for selecting these markers centers on their established role in diagnosing and prognosticating heart disease. LVEF is a crucial measure of cardiac function, while BNP levels correlate with ventricular strain and heart failure severity. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the frequency of adverse events.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Statistical Analysis\n",
      "A sample size of 500 participants was calculated to provide an 80% power to detect a 10% improvement in LVEF with a significance level of 0.05. Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. Continuous variables were compared using paired t-tests, and categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n",

      "### Results\n",
      "500 participants were randomized, with 250 in each group. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Efficacy\n",
      "- Mean LVEF improved by 12% in the CardioX group compared to 4% in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- BNP levels decreased by 30% in the CardioX group, significantly more than the 10% reduction observed in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- The KCCQ scores improved by an average of 15 points in the CardioX group, compared to 5 points in the placebo group (p<0.05).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Safety\n",
      "- Adverse events were reported in 30% of the CardioX group, compared to 25% in the placebo group.\n",
      "- Most common adverse events in the CardioX group included mild gastrointestinal symptoms and transient dizziness.\n",
      "- Serious adverse events were comparable between groups, with no significant differences detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Subgroup Analyses\n",
      "Subgroup analyses revealed that the efficacy of CardioX was consistent across various stages of heart disease, age, and gender differences, highlighting its potential broad applicability.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Discussion\n",
      "CardioX significantly improved key measures of cardiac function and patient quality of life compared to placebo, supporting its efficacy in the treatment of heart disease. The study's strengths include a robust randomized controlled design and comprehensive outcome assessments. The choice of biomarkers such as LVEF and BNP is substantiated by their relevance in clinical heart disease management. \n",
      "\n",
      "Limitations include the relatively short follow-up period and the need for larger studies to confirm long-term efficacy and safety. The discussion section compares these results with existing literature on similar treatments, showing that CardioX's efficacy and safety profile compares favorably with current standards of care.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "This study demonstrates that CardioX is a promising new treatment for heart disease, offering significant improvements in cardiac function and patient quality of life.

      "\n",
      "### Abstract\n",
      "This study investigates the effects of a new drug, CardioX, on heart disease. Conducted over a period of 12 months, the research involved 500 patients diagnosed with varying stages of heart disease. Participants were randomly assigned to either the CardioX group or a placebo group. Efficacy was assessed through changes in key cardiovascular biomarkers and patient symptoms, while safety was monitored through adverse event reporting. Results indicated that CardioX significantly improved cardiac function and patient-reported symptoms with a manageable safety profile, suggesting its potential as a new treatment option for heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Introduction\n",
      "Heart disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CardioX, a novel pharmaceutical agent designed to enhance cardiac function and reduce symptoms associated with heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Methodology\n",
      "#### Study Design\n",
      "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Participants\n",
      "500 patients aged 40-75 with clinically diagnosed heart disease were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or other severe systemic illnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Randomization and Blinding\n",
      "Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CardioX (100 mg daily) or a matching placebo. Randomization was computer-generated, and both participants and researchers were blinded to the group assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Interventions\n",
      "CardioX or placebo was administered orally once daily for 12 months. Adherence to treatment was assessed through pill counts, patient diaries, and electronic monitoring systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Outcome Measures\n",
      "Primary outcomes included changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and levels of biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). The rationale for selecting these markers centers on their established role in diagnosing and prognosticating heart disease. LVEF is a crucial measure of cardiac function, while BNP levels correlate with ventricular strain and heart failure severity. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the frequency of adverse events.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Statistical Analysis\n",
      "A sample size of 500 participants was calculated to provide an 80% power to detect a 10% improvement in LVEF with a significance level of 0.05. Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. Continuous variables were compared using paired t-tests, and categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Introduction\n",
      "Heart disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. According to the World Health Organization, roughly 17.9 million people die from cardiovascular diseases each year, accounting for 31% of global deaths. Despite advances in treatments, current therapies often fall short in reversing the progression of heart disease or significantly improving quality of life for patients. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CardioX, a novel pharmaceutical agent designed to enhance cardiac function and reduce symptoms associated with heart disease. Our hypothesis is that CardioX will significantly improve cardiac function and patient-reported outcomes compared to placebo in patients with heart disease.\n",

      "- The KCCQ scores improved by an average of 15 points (95% CI, 12-18 points) in the CardioX group, compared to 5 points (95% CI, 3-7 points) in the placebo group (p<0.05).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Safety\n",
      "- Adverse events were reported in 30% of the CardioX group, compared to 25% in the placebo group. Common adverse events included mild gastrointestinal symptoms and transient dizziness.\n",

      "### Discussion\n",
      "CardioX significantly improved LVEF, reduced BNP levels, and enhanced patient-reported outcomes, supporting its efficacy in treating heart disease. The strengths of this study include its robust randomized controlled design and comprehensive outcome assessments. The observed efficacy and safety profile of CardioX compares favorably with current heart disease treatments, indicating its potential as an advanced therapeutic option. Potential mechanisms of action for CardioX include enhanced myocardial energy metabolism and reduced ventricular strain. Limitations of this study include the relatively short follow-up period and the need for larger, multicenter trials to confirm long-term efficacy and safety.\n",

      "Medical Editor Response History: [{'content': \"## Title: Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of CardioX in the Treatment of Heart Disease\\n\\n### Abstract\\nThis study investigates the effects of a new drug, CardioX, on heart disease. Conducted over a period of 12 months, the research involved 500 patients diagnosed with varying stages of heart disease. Participants were randomly assigned to either the CardioX group or a placebo group. Efficacy was assessed through changes in key cardiovascular biomarkers and patient symptoms, while safety was monitored through adverse event reporting. Results indicated that CardioX significantly improved cardiac function and patient-reported symptoms with a manageable safety profile, suggesting its potential as a new treatment option for heart disease.\\n\\n### Introduction\\nHeart disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CardioX, a novel pharmaceutical agent designed to enhance cardiac function and reduce symptoms associated with heart disease.\\n\\n### Methodology\\n#### Study Design\\nThis randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.\\n\\n#### Participants\\n500 patients aged 40-75 with clinically diagnosed heart disease were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or other severe systemic illnesses.\\n\\n#### Randomization and Blinding\\nParticipants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CardioX (100 mg daily) or a matching placebo. Randomization was computer-generated, and both participants and researchers were blinded to the group assignments.\\n\\n#### Interventions\\nCardioX or placebo was administered orally once daily for 12 months. Adherence to treatment was assessed through pill counts, patient diaries, and electronic monitoring systems.\\n\\n#### Outcome Measures\\nPrimary outcomes included changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and levels of biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). The rationale for selecting these markers centers on their established role in diagnosing and prognosticating heart disease. LVEF is a crucial measure of cardiac function, while BNP levels correlate with ventricular strain and heart failure severity. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the frequency of adverse events.\\n\\n#### Statistical Analysis\\nA sample size of 500 participants was calculated to provide an 80% power to detect a 10% improvement in LVEF with a significance level of 0.05. Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. Continuous variables were compared using paired t-tests, and categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\\n\\n### Results\\n500 participants were randomized, with 250 in each group. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups.\\n\\n#### Efficacy\\n- Mean LVEF improved by 12% in the CardioX group compared to 4% in the placebo group (p<0.001).\\n- BNP levels decreased by 30% in the CardioX group, significantly more than the 10% reduction observed in the placebo group (p<0.001).\\n- The KCCQ scores improved by an average of 15 points in the CardioX group, compared to 5 points in the placebo group (p<0.05).\\n\\n#### Safety\\n- Adverse events were reported in 30% of the CardioX group, compared to 25% in the placebo group.\\n- Most common adverse events in the CardioX group included mild gastrointestinal symptoms and transient dizziness.\\n- Serious adverse events were comparable between groups, with no significant differences detected.\\n\\n#### Subgroup Analyses\\nSubgroup analyses revealed that the efficacy of CardioX was consistent across various stages of heart disease, age, and gender differences, highlighting its potential broad applicability.\\n\\n### Discussion\\nCardioX significantly improved key measures of cardiac function and patient quality of life compared to placebo, supporting its efficacy in the treatment of heart disease. The study's strengths include a robust randomized controlled design and comprehensive outcome assessments. The choice of biomarkers such as LVEF and BNP is substantiated by their relevance in clinical heart disease management. \\n\\nLimitations include the relatively short follow-up period and the need for larger studies to confirm long-term efficacy and safety. The discussion section compares these results with existing literature on similar treatments, showing that CardioX's efficacy and safety profile compares favorably with current standards of care.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThis study demonstrates that CardioX is a promising new treatment for heart disease, offering significant improvements in cardiac function and patient quality of life. Future studies should focus on long-term outcomes, multicenter trials, and comparisons with existing therapies to further establish CardioX’s role in the management of heart disease.\\n\\n### Acknowledgements\\nThe authors thank the participants, clinical staff, and funding bodies who made this research possible.\\n\\n### References\\n[To be filled in with relevant literature and sources referenced in the study]\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Compliance With Ethical Standards\\n- **Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest:** None reported.\\n- **Research involving human participants and/or animals:** This research involved human participants and was conducted following ethical guidelines.\\n- **Informed consent:** Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.

Conducted over a period of 12 months, the research involved 500 patients diagnosed with varying stages of heart disease. Participants were randomly assigned to either the CardioX group or a placebo group. Efficacy was primarily assessed through changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, while secondary outcomes included patient-reported symptoms measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and frequency of adverse events. Results indicated that CardioX significantly improved cardiac function and patient-reported symptoms with a manageable safety profile, suggesting its potential as a new treatment option for heart disease. Statistical significance was confirmed at p<0.05.\\n\\n### Introduction\\nHeart disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. According to the World Health Organization, roughly 17.9 million people die from cardiovascular diseases each year, accounting for 31% of global deaths. Despite advances in treatments, current therapies often fall short in reversing the progression of heart disease or significantly improving quality of life for patients. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CardioX, a novel pharmaceutical agent designed to enhance cardiac function and reduce symptoms associated with heart disease. Our hypothesis is that CardioX will significantly improve cardiac function and patient-reported outcomes compared to placebo in patients with heart disease.\\n\\n### Methodology\\n#### Study Design\\nThis is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT01234567).\\n\\n#### Participants\\n500 patients aged 40-75 with clinically diagnosed heart disease, classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II to IV, were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or other severe systemic illnesses determined through pre-screening tests.\\n\\n#### Randomization and Blinding\\nParticipants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CardioX (100 mg daily) or a matching placebo using computer-generated sequences. Both participants and researchers were blinded to the group assignments, and placebo capsules were identical in appearance to the treatment drug to prevent unblinding.\\n\\n#### Interventions\\nCardioX or placebo was administered orally once daily for 12 months. Treatment adherence was assessed through pill counts, patient diaries, and electronic monitoring systems, audited periodically.\\n\\n#### Outcome Measures\\nPrimary outcomes included changes in LVEF and BNP levels. Secondary outcomes were patient-reported outcomes measured by the KCCQ and the frequency of adverse events. Pre-specified thresholds for significance were a 5% or greater improvement in LVEF and a 20% or greater reduction in BNP levels.\\n\\n#### Statistical Analysis\\nA sample size of 500 participants was calculated to provide an 80% power to detect a 10% improvement in LVEF with a significance level of 0.05. Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. Continuous variables were compared using paired t-tests, and categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. Adjustments for potential confounders were made by including baseline characteristics in multivariate regression models. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant, with multiple comparisons corrected using the Bonferroni method.\\n\\n### Results\\n500 participants were randomized, with 250 in each group. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups.\\n\\n#### Efficacy\\n- Mean LVEF improved by 12% (95% CI, 10-14%) in the CardioX group compared to 4% (95% CI, 2-6%) in the placebo group (p<0.001, adjusted).\\n- BNP levels decreased by 30% (95% CI, 25-35%) in the CardioX group, significantly more than the 10% (95% CI, 5-15%) reduction observed in the placebo group (p<0.001, adjusted).\\n- The KCCQ scores improved by an average of 15 points (95% CI, 12-18 points) in the CardioX group, compared to 5 points (95% CI, 3-7 points) in the placebo group (p<0.05).\\n\\n#### Safety\\n- Adverse events were reported in 30% of the CardioX group, compared to 25% in the placebo group. Common adverse events included mild gastrointestinal symptoms and transient dizziness.\\n- Serious adverse events were comparable between groups (CardioX: 3%, Placebo: 4%).\\n- Adverse events were categorized using a pre-specified severity grading system, with a clinical adjudication committee reviewing all serious events.\\n\\n#### Subgroup Analyses\\nSubgroup analyses revealed consistent efficacy of CardioX across varying stages of heart disease, age, and gender. Subgroups were defined based on baseline disease severity, age brackets, and gender. Statistical methods included interaction terms in regression models to evaluate differential effects across subgroups.\\n\\n### Discussion\\nCardioX significantly improved LVEF, reduced BNP levels, and enhanced patient-reported outcomes, supporting its efficacy in treating heart disease. The strengths of this study include its robust randomized controlled design and comprehensive outcome assessments. The observed efficacy and safety profile of CardioX compares favorably with current heart disease treatments, indicating its potential as an advanced therapeutic option. Potential mechanisms of action for CardioX include enhanced myocardial energy metabolism and reduced ventricular strain. Limitations of this study include the relatively short follow-up period and the need for larger, multicenter trials to confirm long-term efficacy and safety.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThis study demonstrates that CardioX is a promising treatment for heart disease, offering significant improvements in cardiac function and patient quality of life. Future research should focus on long-term outcomes, multicenter trials, and comparisons with existing therapies to further establish CardioX’s role in the management of heart disease.\\n\\n### Acknowledgements\\nThe authors thank the participants, clinical staff, and funding bodies who made this research possible.\\n\\n### References\\n[To be filled in with relevant literature and sources referenced in the study]\\n\\n### Compliance With Ethical Standards\\n- **Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest:** None reported.\\n- **Research involving human participants and/or animals:** This research involved human participants and was conducted following ethical guidelines.\\n- **Informed consent:** Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.

      "### Abstract\n",
      "This study investigates the effects of a new drug, CardioX, on heart disease. Conducted over a period of 12 months, the research involved 500 patients diagnosed with varying stages of heart disease. Participants were randomly assigned to either the CardioX group or a placebo group. Efficacy was assessed through changes in key cardiovascular biomarkers and patient symptoms, while safety was monitored through adverse event reporting. Results indicated that CardioX significantly improved cardiac function and patient-reported symptoms with a manageable safety profile, suggesting its potential as a new treatment option for heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Introduction\n",
      "Heart disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CardioX, a novel pharmaceutical agent designed to enhance cardiac function and reduce symptoms associated with heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Methodology\n",
      "#### Study Design\n",
      "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Participants\n",
      "500 patients aged 40-75 with clinically diagnosed heart disease were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or other severe systemic illnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Randomization and Blinding\n",
      "Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CardioX (100 mg daily) or a matching placebo. Randomization was computer-generated, and both participants and researchers were blinded to the group assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Interventions\n",
      "CardioX or placebo was administered orally once daily for 12 months. Adherence to treatment was assessed through pill counts, patient diaries, and electronic monitoring systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Outcome Measures\n",
      "Primary outcomes included changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and levels of biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). The rationale for selecting these markers centers on their established role in diagnosing and prognosticating heart disease. LVEF is a crucial measure of cardiac function, while BNP levels correlate with ventricular strain and heart failure severity. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the frequency of adverse events.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Statistical Analysis\n",
      "A sample size of 500 participants was calculated to provide an 80% power to detect a 10% improvement in LVEF with a significance level of 0.05. Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. Continuous variables were compared using paired t-tests, and categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Results\n",
      "500 participants were randomized, with 250 in each group. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Efficacy\n",
      "- Mean LVEF improved by 12% in the CardioX group compared to 4% in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- BNP levels decreased by 30% in the CardioX group, significantly more than the 10% reduction observed in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- The KCCQ scores improved by an average of 15 points in the CardioX group, compared to 5 points in the placebo group (p<0.05).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Safety\n",
      "- Adverse events were reported in 30% of the CardioX group, compared to 25% in the placebo group.\n",
      "- Most common adverse events in the CardioX group included mild gastrointestinal symptoms and transient dizziness.\n",
      "- Serious adverse events were comparable between groups, with no significant differences detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Subgroup Analyses\n",
      "Subgroup analyses revealed that the efficacy of CardioX was consistent across various stages of heart disease, age, and gender differences, highlighting its potential broad applicability.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Discussion\n",
      "CardioX significantly improved key measures of cardiac function and patient quality of life compared to placebo, supporting its efficacy in the treatment of heart disease. The study's strengths include a robust randomized controlled design and comprehensive outcome assessments. The choice of biomarkers such as LVEF and BNP is substantiated by their relevance in clinical heart disease management. \n",
      "\n",
      "Limitations include the relatively short follow-up period and the need for larger studies to confirm long-term efficacy and safety. The discussion section compares these results with existing literature on similar treatments, showing that CardioX's efficacy and safety profile compares favorably with current standards of care.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "This study demonstrates that CardioX is a promising new treatment for heart disease, offering significant improvements in cardiac function and patient quality of life. Future studies should focus on long-term outcomes, multicenter trials, and comparisons with existing therapies to further establish CardioX’s role in the management of heart disease.\n",

      "### Abstract\n",
      "\n",
      "This study investigates the effects of a new drug, CardioX, on heart disease. Conducted over a period of 12 months, the research involved 500 patients diagnosed with varying stages of heart disease. Participants were randomly assigned to either the CardioX group or a placebo group. Efficacy was assessed through changes in key cardiovascular biomarkers and patient symptoms, while safety was monitored through adverse event reporting. Results indicated that CardioX significantly improved cardiac function and patient-reported symptoms with a manageable safety profile, suggesting its potential as a new treatment option for heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",

      "### Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Heart disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CardioX, a novel pharmaceutical agent designed to enhance cardiac function and reduce symptoms associated with heart disease.\n",

      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Study Design\n",
      "\n",
      "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), specifically the [Name of IRB Committee], under IRB approval number [IRB Number]. The trial was conducted in adherence to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Participants\n",
      "\n",
      "500 patients aged 40-75 with clinically diagnosed heart disease were enrolled. The age range of 40-75 was selected to focus on the population most commonly affected by heart disease and to ensure the safety and efficacy of CardioX in this demographic. Pregnant women and individuals with renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or other severe systemic illnesses were excluded due to the potential for increased risk or confounding variables. Efforts to ensure inclusion of diverse demographic groups (e.g., gender, race) within the chosen age range were implemented to generalize findings appropriately.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Randomization and Blinding\n",
      "\n",
      "Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CardioX (100 mg daily) or a matching placebo. Randomization was computer-generated, and both participants and researchers were blinded to the group assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Interventions\n",
      "\n",
      "CardioX or placebo was administered orally once daily for 12 months. Adherence to treatment was assessed through pill counts and patient diaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Outcome Measures\n",
      "\n",
      "Primary outcomes included changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and levels of biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the frequency of adverse events.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Statistical Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. Continuous variables were compared using paired t-tests, and categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. Missing data were addressed using multiple imputation methods to preserve the integrity of the dataset. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the findings under various assumptions. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Results\n",
      "\n",
      "500 participants were successfully randomized, with 250 in each group. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Efficacy\n",
      "\n",
      "- Mean LVEF improved by 12% in the CardioX group compared to 4% in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- BNP levels decreased by 30% in the CardioX group, significantly more than the 10% reduction observed in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- The KCCQ scores improved by an average of 15 points in the CardioX group, compared to 5 points in the placebo group (p<0.05).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Safety\n",
      "\n",
      "Adverse events were reported in 30% of the CardioX group, compared to 25% in the placebo group. Adverse events were categorized by severity as mild, moderate, or severe. Mild events included symptoms like minor gastrointestinal disturbances and dizziness. Serious adverse events, defined as any event resulting in hospitalization, being life-threatening, or requiring discontinuation of the study drug, were comparable between groups, with no significant differences detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "CardioX significantly improved key measures of cardiac function and patient quality of life compared to placebo, supporting its efficacy in the treatment of heart disease. The manageable safety profile observed aligns with expectations for a novel therapeutic agent. While CardioX demonstrated significant improvements in cardiac function and quality of life, the incidence of adverse events was slightly higher in the treatment group (30% vs. 25%). A comprehensive risk-benefit analysis suggests that, given the benefits observed, the adverse events are manageable. However, ongoing monitoring is essential to ensure patient safety. The study's strengths include a robust randomized controlled design and comprehensive outcome assessments. Limitations include the relatively short follow-up period and the need for larger studies to confirm long-term efficacy and safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This study demonstrates that CardioX is a promising new treatment for heart disease, offering significant improvements in cardiac function and patient quality of life. Future studies should focus on long-term outcomes and comparisons with existing therapies to further establish CardioX’s role in the management of heart disease.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Introduction\n",
      "Heart disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CardioX, a novel pharmaceutical agent designed to enhance cardiac function and reduce symptoms associated with heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Methodology\n",
      "#### Study Design\n",
      "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Participants\n",
      "500 patients aged 40-75 with clinically diagnosed heart disease were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or other severe systemic illnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Randomization and Blinding\n",
      "Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CardioX (100 mg daily) or a matching placebo. Randomization was computer-generated, and both participants and researchers were blinded to the group assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Interventions\n",
      "CardioX or placebo was administered orally once daily for 12 months. Adherence to treatment was assessed through pill counts and patient diaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Outcome Measures\n",
      "Primary outcomes included changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and levels of biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the frequency of adverse events.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Statistical Analysis\n",
      "Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. Continuous variables were compared using paired t-tests, and categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Results\n",
      "500 participants were randomized, with 250 in each group. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Efficacy\n",
      "- Mean LVEF improved by 12% in the CardioX group compared to 4% in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- BNP levels decreased by 30% in the CardioX group, significantly more than the 10% reduction observed in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- The KCCQ scores improved by an average of 15 points in the CardioX group, compared to 5 points in the placebo group (p<0.05).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Safety\n",
      "- Adverse events were reported in 30% of the CardioX group, compared to 25% in the placebo group.\n",
      "- Most common adverse events in the CardioX group included mild gastrointestinal symptoms and transient dizziness.\n",
      "- Serious adverse events were comparable between groups, with no significant differences detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Discussion\n",
      "CardioX significantly improved key measures of cardiac function and patient quality of life compared to placebo, supporting its efficacy in the treatment of heart disease. The manageable safety profile observed aligns with expectations for a novel therapeutic agent. The study's strengths include a robust randomized controlled design and comprehensive outcome assessments. \n",
      "\n",
      "Limitations include the relatively short follow-up period and the need for larger studies to confirm long-term efficacy and safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "This study demonstrates that CardioX is a promising new treatment for heart disease, offering significant improvements in cardiac function and patient quality of life. Future studies should focus on long-term outcomes and comparisons with existing therapies to further establish CardioX’s role in the management of heart disease.\n",

      "### Ethical Considerations\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Ethical Approval\n",
      "**Current Text**: \"This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggested Revision**: \"This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), specifically the [Name of IRB Committee], under IRB approval number [IRB Number]. The trial was conducted in adherence to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Informed Consent Process\n",
      "**Current Text**: \"Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggested Revision**: \"Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study through a comprehensive consent process. Participants received written and verbal explanations regarding the study’s purpose, procedures, potential risks and benefits, and their right to withdraw at any time without consequences. The consent form received IRB approval to ensure it conforms to ethical standards.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Conflict of Interest Declaration\n",
      "**Current Text**: \"None reported.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggested Revision**: \"The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest related to this study. Any financial relationships or affiliations that could be perceived as potential conflicts of interest have been disclosed and reviewed by the IRB.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Data Privacy\n",
      "**Suggested Addition**: \"The study was conducted in compliance with data privacy regulations, including GDPR and HIPAA. All patient data were anonymized and securely stored in accordance with these regulations. Data access was restricted to authorized personnel only, and data protection measures included encryption and secure password protocols.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### Adverse Events Reporting\n",
      "\n",
      "**Current Text**: \"Adverse events were reported in 30% of the CardioX group, compared to 25% in the placebo group. Most common adverse events in the CardioX group included mild gastrointestinal symptoms and transient dizziness. Serious adverse events were comparable between groups, with no significant differences detected.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggested Addition**: \"Adverse events were categorized by severity as mild, moderate, or severe. Mild events included symptoms like minor gastrointestinal disturbances and dizziness. Serious adverse events were defined as any event resulting in hospitalization, being life-threatening, or requiring discontinuation of the study drug. Detailed accounting of serious adverse events showed no significant differences between groups (specific numbers and nature of events need to be included).\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### Risk-Benefit Analysis\n",
      "**Suggested Addition**: \"While CardioX demonstrated significant improvements in cardiac function and quality of life, the incidence of adverse events was slightly higher in the treatment group (30% vs. 25%). A comprehensive risk-benefit analysis suggests that, given the benefits observed, the adverse events are manageable. However, ongoing monitoring is essential to ensure patient safety. Future studies should further evaluate long-term risks and benefits.\"\n",

      "## Title: Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of CardioX in the Treatment of Heart Disease\n",
      "\n",
      "### Abstract\n",
      "This study investigates the effects of a new drug, CardioX, on heart disease. Conducted over a period of 12 months, the research involved 500 patients diagnosed with varying stages of heart disease. Participants were randomly assigned to either the CardioX group or a placebo group. Efficacy was assessed through changes in key cardiovascular biomarkers and patient symptoms, while safety was monitored through adverse event reporting. Results indicated that CardioX significantly improved cardiac function and patient-reported symptoms with a manageable safety profile, suggesting its potential as a new treatment option for heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Introduction\n",
      "Heart disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CardioX, a novel pharmaceutical agent designed to enhance cardiac function and reduce symptoms associated with heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Methodology\n",
      "#### Study Design\n",
      "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), specifically the [Name of IRB Committee], under IRB approval number [IRB Number]. The trial was conducted in adherence to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Participants\n",
      "500 patients aged 40-75 with clinically diagnosed heart disease were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or other severe systemic illnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Informed Consent Process\n",
      "Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study through a comprehensive consent process. Participants received written and verbal explanations regarding the study’s purpose, procedures, potential risks and benefits, and their right to withdraw at any time without consequences. The consent form received IRB approval to ensure it conforms to ethical standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Randomization and Blinding\n",
      "Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CardioX (100 mg daily) or a matching placebo. Randomization was computer-generated, and both participants and researchers were blinded to the group assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Interventions\n",
      "CardioX or placebo was administered orally once daily for 12 months. Adherence to treatment was assessed through pill counts and patient diaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Outcome Measures\n",
      "Primary outcomes included changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and levels of biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the frequency of adverse events.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Statistical Analysis\n",
      "Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. Continuous variables were compared using paired t-tests, and categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. Missing data were addressed using multiple imputation methods to preserve the integrity of the dataset. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the findings under various assumptions. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Results\n",
      "500 participants were randomized, with 250 in each group. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Efficacy\n",
      "- Mean LVEF improved by 12% in the CardioX group compared to 4% in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- BNP levels decreased by 30% in the CardioX group, significantly more than the 10% reduction observed in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- The KCCQ scores improved by an average of 15 points in the CardioX group, compared to 5 points in the placebo group (p<0.05).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Safety\n",
      "Adverse events were categorized by severity as mild, moderate, or severe. Mild events included symptoms like minor gastrointestinal disturbances and dizziness. Serious adverse events were defined as any event resulting in hospitalization, being life-threatening, or requiring discontinuation of the study drug. Detailed accounting of serious adverse events showed no significant differences between groups, with five events in the CardioX group and four in the placebo group.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Discussion\n",
      "CardioX significantly improved key measures of cardiac function and patient quality of life compared to placebo, supporting its efficacy in the treatment of heart disease. The manageable safety profile observed aligns with expectations for a novel therapeutic agent. The study's strengths include a robust randomized controlled design and comprehensive outcome assessments. \n",
      "\n",
      "While CardioX demonstrated significant improvements in cardiac function and quality of life, the incidence of adverse events was slightly higher in the treatment group (30% vs. 25%). A comprehensive risk-benefit analysis suggests that, given the benefits observed, the adverse events are manageable. However, ongoing monitoring is essential to ensure patient safety. Future studies should further evaluate long-term risks and benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "This study demonstrates that CardioX is a promising new treatment for heart disease, offering significant improvements in cardiac function and patient quality of life. Future studies should focus on long-term outcomes and comparisons with existing therapies to further establish CardioX’s role in the management of heart disease.\n",

Sirtuins are divided into five \\nsubclasses based on the conserved catalytic core \\ndomain. Class I is comprised of SIRT1, 2, and 3, which \\nexhibit robust deacetylase activity. SIRT4, a class II \\nSirtuin, \\nfunctions \\npredominantly \\nas \\nan \\nADP-ribosyltransferase \\nin \\nmitochondria. \\nSIRT5 \\nbelongs to Class III, while SIRT6 and 7 are assigned to \\nClass IV. The U class sirtuins have only been observed \\nin bacteria. Although subcellular localization and \\nfunctions are different, mammalian sirtuins have \\ndifferent divisions of labor from regulating genome \\nstability and energy metabolism to responding to \\ncellular stress, working together to regulate the fate of \\ncells as well as participating in various disease \\nprocesses (Table 1) [2-4]. Among them, SIRT3 \\nlocalizes mainly to the mitochondrial matrix and \\nplays an important role in regulating mitochondrial \\nmetabolism, including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) \\ncycle, the urea cycle, amino acid metabolism, fatty \\nacid \\noxidation, \\nETC/oxidative \\nphosphorylation \\n(OXPHOS), \\nROS \\ndetoxification, \\nmitochondrial \\ndynamics and the mitochondrial unfolded protein \\nresponse (UPR) [5, 6]. \\nThe SIRT3 protein is widely expressed in \\nmitochondria-rich tissues, such as kidney, heart, brain \\nand liver tissue [12]. The acetylation modifications \\nthat are regulated by SIRT3 are essential for \\nmaintaining mitochondrial function in these tissues. \\nGiven the crucial role of mitochondria in energy \\ngeneration, metabolism, apoptosis and intracellular \\nsignaling [13], these highly metabolic tissues are more \\nsensitive \\nto \\nmitochondrial \\ndysfunction. \\nNot \\nsurprisingly, SIRT3 has been verified to regulate \\naging, neurodegeneration, liver disease, kidney \\ndisease, heart disease and other metabolic diseases \\n(Figure 1) [13].

(A) The conserved enzymatic core of SIRT3 contains a NAD+ binding domain, a zinc binding motif and the binding sites of SIRT3 \\nsubstrates. (B) The modification by SIRT3 is deacetylate its substrate with a NAD+ dependent manner. (C) Typical SIRT3 regulated biological function. SIRT3 assists mitochondria \\nto maintain metabolic stability including the homeostasis of TCA cycle, Urea cycle, Amino acid metabolism, Fatty acid oxidation, ETC/OXPHOS, ROS detoxification and \\nmitochondrial dynamics. Moreover, SIRT3 is closely related with oxidative stress, apoptosis, autophagy and inflammation. \\n \\nStructure and function of SIRT3 \\nAs a typical sirtuin, SIRT3 has a conserved \\nenzymatic \\ncore \\n(aa126-399) \\nundertaking \\nthe \\ndeacetylation function and acts in an NAD+ \\ndependent manner. The core region contains a large \\nRossmann fold domain for NAD+ binding and a \\nsmaller domain comprising of a helical bundle and a \\nzinc-binding motif which is formed by two loops \\nextending from the large domain. The remainder of \\nthe enzymatic core is composed of the binding sites \\nfor SIRT3 substrates (Figure 2A) [14]. Strictly \\nspeaking, the NAD+-dependent SIRT3 deacetylation \\nreaction process includes four steps. First, the \\nacetylated substrate and the NAD+ co-substrate bind \\nin a cleft between the Rossmann-fold and zinc- \\nbinding domains, thereby inducing closure of the \\nactive site and stabilization of the NAD+ binding loop. \\nThen the nicotinamide moiety of NAD+ is induced \\nand \\nburied \\nin \\nthe \\nnearby \\nhighly \\nconserved \\nTheranostics 2020, Vol. 10, Issue 18 \\n \\n \\nhttp://www.thno.org \\n8318 \\nhydrophobic pocket in a productive conformation. \\nSubsequently, this conformation orients the α-face of \\nNAD+ toward the acyl substrate, exposing the C1 \\natom of the ribose ring for direct nucleophilic attack \\nfrom the carbonyl oxygen of acyl substrate. The acetyl \\ngroup consequently transfers from the substrate to the \\nADP-ribose moiety of NAD+ coupled with cleavage of \\nthe nicotinamide from NAD+. Next, the C1’-O- \\nalkylamidate intermediate converts to the bicyclic \\nintermediate with the aid of the conserved His 224, \\nwhich induces a nucleophilic attack of the 2’-OH \\ngroup of the ribose onto the iminium carbon of the \\nO-alkylamidate intermediate. Finally, the bicyclic \\nintermediate is disrupted by an activated water \\nmolecule to produce the deacetylated protein and \\n2’-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (Figure 2B). SIRT3 not only \\nremoves acetyl groups, but also crotonyl and \\nmyristoyl groups. However lysine acetylation is the \\nmost \\nextensively \\nstudied \\nmodification \\n[17]. \\nMitochondrial \\nproteins \\nare \\nrelatively \\nhighly \\nacetylated \\n(nearly \\n20%) \\n[18] \\nand \\nacetylation \\nmodification is involved in all aspects of mitochondria \\nfunction. Therefore, acetylation modification is \\npivotal to mitochondrial destiny. In a recent report, \\nthe most important mitochondria sirtuin, SIRT3, can \\ndirectly interact with at least 84 mitochondria \\nproteins. These proteins are involved in all aspects of \\nmitochondria \\nbiological \\nfunction, \\nincluding \\nmitochondrial \\nmitosis \\n(CHCHD3, \\nIMMT), \\ntranscription \\n(TFAM, \\nMTIF2, \\netc.), \\ntranslation \\n(MRPL11, MRPS34, etc.), DNA processing (POLB, \\nPOLDIP2,etc.), RNA processing (PNPT1, RNMTL1, \\netc.), lipid metabolism (ACADM, AGK , etc.), ETC/ \\nOXPHOS (NDUFA5, ATP5B and etc.), the TCA cycle \\n(OGDH, DLST and etc.), as well as amino acid \\nmetabolism (GLUD1, OAT, etc.) [19]. Together, SIRT3 \\nsupports \\nthe \\nmaintenance \\nof \\nmitochondrial \\nhomeostasis by regulating the acetylation levels of its \\nsubstrates (Figure 2C). \\nEndogenous regulators of SIRT3 \\nSIRT3 is important in mitochondria, and \\ntherefore it is regulated in various ways. There are \\nseveral studies on endogenous regulators of its \\nexpression, as well as transcriptional and post- \\ntranslational modifications on this protein (Table 2). \\nSIRT3 is a sensor of mitochondrial energy, thus levels \\nof the metabolic co-factor (NAD+) and the byproduct \\nnicotinamide are direct regulators of its activity. As \\nthe \\nco-factor \\nof \\nSIRT3, \\nNAD+ \\npromotes \\nthe \\ndeacetylation process [20] while nicotinamide inhibits \\nthis process through accelerating the reverse reaction \\nby binding to the reaction product [17, 21]. In \\naddition, caloric restriction (CR) is another crucial \\nfactor that can obviously stimulate the expression of \\nSIRT3, which is also a biological self-protection \\nstrategy. In response to CR, the up-regulated SIRT3 \\nactivates mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 \\n(IDH2) by deacetylation, thus increasing the NADPH \\nlevel to reduce oxidative damage and enhance the \\nmitochondrial antioxidant defense system [20]. SIRT3 \\nis transcribed in the nucleus and full-length SIRT3 \\n(FLSIRT3) has no enzyme activity. FLSIRT3 is \\nimported into the mitochondria, then its NH2 \\nterminus \\nis \\nproteolytically \\ncleaved \\nin \\nthe \\nmitochondrial matrix to become the active form, \\nSIRT3 (an approximately 28kDa product). During this \\nprocess, matrix processing peptidase (MPP) acts as \\n“scissors” \\nto \\naccomplish \\nthis \\npost-translational \\nmodification [22]. SUMOylation is another post- \\ntranslational modification on SIRT3, which further \\ninhibits its activity. SUMO specific protease SENP1 \\ncan de-SUMOylate and activate SIRT3 to promote \\nmitochondria metabolism [23]. SIRT3 can also be \\nregulated by covalent modification. 4-Hydroxy-\\nnonenal (4-HNE) is an endogenous product of lipid \\nperoxidation which inhibits SIRT3 activity by \\noccupying its zinc-binding residue (Cys 280) [24]. In \\naddition, transcriptional modification is another \\nmajor regulation of SIRT3. NF-κB, which is a \\npleiotropic \\ntranscription \\nfactor, \\nwas \\nrecently \\nidentified to bind to the SIRT3 promoter to enhance its \\nexpression [25]. Peroxisome proliferator-activated \\nreceptor γ (PPARγ) coactivator 1 (PGC-1α) could bind \\nto \\nthe \\nSIRT3 \\npromoter \\nto \\nstimulate \\nSIRT3 \\ntranscription [26, 27], while SNAI1 and Zinc finger E- \\nbox-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) negatively regulates \\nthe SIRT3 promoter activity to inhibit its expression \\n[28, 29]. Of note, microRNAs (miRNAs) are mainly \\npost-transcriptional regulators that affect mRNA \\nstability and protein levels which can also regulate \\nSIRT3 activity. As a class of non-coding RNA \\nmolecules, miRNAs bind to complementary target \\nmRNAs, resulting in mRNA translational inhibition \\nor degradation [30]. Studies have proven that miR-195 \\n[31], miR-421 [32], miR-494-3p [33], miR-708-5p [34], \\nmiR-31 [35], miR-145 [36], miR-298 [37] could directly \\ntarget the 3’UTR of SIRT3, thus inhibiting its gene \\nexpression and protein levels. In addition, miR-210 \\ntargets and represses the iron-sulfur cluster assembly \\nprotein (ISCU), which changes the NAD+/NADH \\nratio, indirectly influencing SIRT3 [38]. Long non- \\ncoding RNA (LncRNAs) play a similar role to \\nmiRNAs as well. LncRNA TUG1 suppresses the \\nmRNA expression of miR-145, which can further \\npositively regulate SIRT3 [36], while LncRNA \\nDYNLRB2-2 \\ninhibits \\nmiR-298 \\nto \\nactivate \\nthe \\ntranscription of SIRT3 [37]. The protein-protein \\nnetwork is another primary method of regulating \\nSIRT3 activity. Profilin1, an actin-associated protein, \\nTheranostics 2020, Vol. 10, Issue 18 \\n \\n \\nhttp://www.thno.org \\n8319 \\ncan interact with SIRT3 and promote its expression \\n[39]. β-catenin, a key downstream effector in the Wnt \\nsignaling pathway, can suppress SIRT3 promoter \\nactivity thus inhibiting its expression [40]. As \\nmentioned above, these endogenous regulators \\nmodulate the expression and activities of SIRT3 in \\nresponse to cellular stresses, thus maintaining \\nhomeostasis. \\nSIRT3 and human disease \\n“Small” modification, “big” function \\nThe biological function of SIRT3, which is just \\ndeacetylation of its substrate, seems to be relatively \\nsimple and limited, but it does participate in \\nnumerous biological processes and the development \\nof various diseases [41, 42]. The most fascinating role \\nof SIRT3 is in longevity. It was first reported in 2003 \\nthat SIRT3 is positively associated with longevity [43], \\nand much subsequent work has confirmed and \\nexpanded this result [44-46]. More delightfully, \\nstudies have proven that SIRT3 protects human heart, \\nbrain, muscle, liver, kidney and other tissues from \\ndysfunction and disease [46]. SIRT3 is also involved in \\nthe overall progression of cancer. It may function \\ndifferently in various conditions, but it mostly inhibits \\nthe development of cancer [14]. Here, we will discuss \\nhow SIRT3 fights against human diseases by \\nregulating specific substrate proteins and their \\ncorresponding signaling pathways. \\nSIRT3 in age-related disease \\nAge-related disease usually occurs with high \\nfrequency after a certain point, and these diseases are \\nalways accompanied by the gradual decline of \\nfunction in various organs. In this section, we mainly \\nfocus on aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD) [47], \\nParkinson's disease (PD) [48], Huntington's disease \\n(HD) [49], amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [50] and \\nage-related hearing loss (Figure 3). Aging is a complex \\nand irreversible process. Although the pathological \\nfeatures of aging vary considerably, they all bear the \\ncommon characteristic that the smallest components \\nof lesions, such as neuronal or muscle cells, have \\ndecreased or imbalanced mitochondrial function and \\nincreased oxidative damage [51]. Under normal \\ncircumstances, SIRT3 is highly expressed in the brain \\nand nervous system, but decreased SIRT3 expression \\nis always observed in age-related diseases and this \\nage-dependent defect of SIRT3 is a major risk factor of \\npathogenesis [52-54]. \\nAnother well-studied role of SIRT3 in age- \\nrelated disease is that it can act to resist apoptosis. \\nProgressive loss and death of neuronal cells is a \\nfeature of these diseases, and apoptosis plays an \\nimportant role in this process. P53, the most famous \\ntumor suppressor gene, is highly acetylated in \\nneurodegenerative \\ndiseases. \\nAc-p53K320 \\ntargets \\nmitochondria and directly reduces its function, \\ninducing mitochondrial dysfunction which leads to \\nmitochondrial-dependent \\napoptosis. \\nSIRT3 \\ndeacetylates p53 to prevent its localization-induced \\nreleasing of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to \\nthe cytoplasm [53]. Moreover, SIRT3 activates \\nFOXO3α, a transcription factor of the FOXO family \\nwhich is involved in metabolism-regulation and stress \\nresponse, to inhibit Bax-regulated apoptosis [57]. \\nSIRT3 can deacetylate CypD, a regulatory component \\nof the mitochondrial permeability transition pore \\n(mPTP), to inhibit the mitochondrial permeability \\ntransition to prevent apoptosis and mitochondrial \\ndysfunction [58]. In response to age-dependent \\nmitochondrial capacity reduction, SIRT3 binds to \\nATP5O, a mitochondrial ATP synthase, strengthening \\nthe ETC/OXPHOS process to enhance cellular ATP \\nproduction [19]. Recently, studies have shown that the \\nactivation of SIRT3 and the inhibition of apoptosis \\nplay an important role in the improvement of age- \\nrelated diseases. For example, celastrol can ameliorate \\nage-related macular degeneration via SIRT3 activation \\nand apoptosis inhibition [59]. Melatonin decelerated \\nage-induced ovarian aging via activating SIRT3- \\nregulated \\nmitochondrial \\nfunction \\nenhancement \\ntogether \\nwith \\napoptosis \\ninhibition \\n[60]. \\nNot \\nsurprisingly, \\ndaily \\nmelatonin \\nsupplementation \\nprotects vascular endothelium from aging via SIRT3- \\nregulated oxidative stress suppression and apoptosis \\ninhibition [61]. Accordingly, up-regulation of SIRT3 \\nplus \\napoptosis \\ninhibitors \\nmight \\nprovide \\nnew \\ndirections for age-related disease treatment. SIRT3 can \\nactivate autophagy, a notable cellular self-protective \\nmechanism. SIRT3 can deacetylate LKB1 to activate \\nthe AMPK-mTOR autophagy pathway [62]. More \\ninteresting, \\ndeacetylated \\nFOXO3α \\ncan \\nactivate \\nexpression of various autophagy genes (ULK1, ATG5, \\nATG7, et al) to protect cells from apoptosis [63]. \\nMitophagy \\nis \\nindispensable \\nfor \\nmaintaining \\nmitochondrial homeostasis and is a specific form of \\nautophagy that selectively removes dysfunctional \\nmitochondria. When an organ is unable to repair \\ndysfunctional mitochondria, mitophagy helps to \\nprovide for metabolic needs and contributes to \\nmitochondrial renewal [64]. SIRT3 induces the \\ninitiation and \\nactivation \\nof \\nthe PINK1-Parkin \\nmitophagy pathway to inhibit cell death [65]. \\nInduction of autophagy is a new hotspot in the \\ntreatment of neurodegenerative diseases [66, 67]. \\nTherefore, SIRT3 activation along with autophagy \\nactivators (like ULK1 activators [68, 69], rapamycin \\n[70]) will be a new candidate method for treatment of \\nthese diseases. Of note, another major pathogenesis of \\nTheranostics 2020, Vol. 10, Issue 18 \\n \\n \\nhttp://www.thno.org \\n8320 \\nage-related disease is the aggregation of pathological \\nproteins (such as Aβ, tau in AD, and α-synuclein in \\nPD) [47-50]. Recently, nicotinamide mononucleotide \\nadenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2), a substrate of \\nSIRT3, was found to be a neuron protector by \\ninteracting with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) to \\nrefold aggregated protein substrates [71]. SIRT3 can \\ninteract with NMNAT2 and activate it to improve \\nmitochondrial function and inhibit apoptosis [72]. \\nMore interestingly, NMNAT2 is a neuron-specific and \\neffective protector which inhibits axonal degeneration \\nand dysfunction, and it is very likely that SIRT3 can \\npromote this function [73]. It is noteworthy that \\nSIRT3-induced autophagy might also be an effective \\nmethod to eliminate these pathological proteins, thus \\nSIRT3 activation together with “toxic protein” \\nscavenging drugs might be beneficial. Taken together, \\nSIRT3 is the nemesis of age-related diseases and it \\nfights against almost all the aspects of their \\ndevelopment. Properly targeting SIRT3 will be \\npromising in these diseases. \\nSIRT3 in cancer \\nCancer cells exhibit metabolic patterns that are \\ndistinct \\nfrom \\nnormal \\ncells. \\nThe \\nfeature \\nof \\nmitochondria \\nmetabolic \\nreprogramming \\nis \\nthe \\n“Warburg effect” [74], which is that most cancer cells \\nare more dependent on aerobic glycolysis than \\noxidative phosphorylation, regardless of the fact that \\nglycolysis produces ATP inefficiently. Glycolysis not \\nonly provides a rapid energy supply, but also \\nprovides a number of favorable factors for the \\noccurrence \\nand \\ndevelopment \\nof \\ntumor \\nmicroenvironments, \\nsuch \\nas \\naccelerating \\nthe \\ninstability of genome and the positive response to \\nmultiple cell proliferation signals (PI3K/AKT, c-Myc, \\netc.) [75, 76]. Of course, in some specific cancers or \\nspecific circumstances (such as brain cancer and acute \\nmyeloid leukemia), OXPHOS is still their more \\nsuitable means of energy supply, and the survival of \\nthese cancers is more dependent on the continued \\nactivity \\nof \\nOXPHOS \\n[77-79]. \\nThe \\ntumor \\nmicroenvironment \\nof \\ndifferent \\ncancers \\nvaries \\nconsiderably, and the pressure of survival makes \\nthem evolve to choose the most suitable metabolic \\npathway. \\nIn \\nshort, \\nSIRT3 \\npromotes \\noxidative \\nphosphorylation and inhibits glycolysis in the overall \\nregulation of mitochondrial metabolism [80, 81]. \\nIntriguingly, a recent study found that SIRT3 changes \\nto \\nan \\noncogene \\nto \\npromote \\nHFD-induced \\ntumorigenesis in mice [82]. Therefore, the role of \\nSIRT3 in cancer appears context-dependent [83]. In \\nmost cases, it is carcinogenic in some cancers that are \\naddicted to OXPHOS [77]. However, it is also a tumor \\nsuppressor in glycolysis-dependent cancers [80, 81, \\n84]. Since the role of SIRT3 in cancer has been widely \\nreported and is well summarized, in this part we \\nmainly focus on how SIRT3 regulates its substrates to \\nplay a double-sided role in cancer. \\n \\n \\nTable 2.

SIRT3 in age-related disease. Age-related diseases are always accompanied with a decline in mitochondrial function, high oxidative stress and accumulation of \\ntoxic proteins. SIRT3 activates a range of substrates by deacetylation to promote mitochondrial function, enhance ATP production, accelerate ROS clearance, and maintain \\nmitochondrial metabolic homeostasis. In addition, SIRT3 can activate mitophagy to accelerate mitochondrial renewal. It is worth noting that SIRT3 also inhibits the production \\nof misfolded proteins and accelerates their clearance. The pink proteins represent the substrates of SIRT3. Gray circles represent acetylation modifications. \\n \\nTumor suppressor role of SIRT3 \\nThe most important tumor suppression role of \\nSIRT3 is that it hinders cancer metabolism changes. \\nThe inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF1α) \\nby SIRT3 is the most studied pathway. HIF1α is a key \\nfactor that activates a series of glycolysis genes which \\ncontribute to the “Warburg phenotype”. SIRT3 can \\ndestabilize HIF1α to prevent its deleterious role of \\n“Warburg effect” promotion. Interestingly, HIF1α is \\nnot the direct substrate of SIRT3. SIRT3 regulates the \\nactivity of HIF1α by direct deacetylation of prolyl \\nhydroxylase \\n(PHD). \\nActivated \\nPHDs \\nthen \\nhydroxylate HIF1α to affect its stability and decrease \\nits tumor promoting effect [81]. The pyruvate \\ndehydrogenase complex (PDCs) is another SIRT3 \\nsubstrate related to glycolysis. In the process of \\nhypoxia and tumor growth, lysine acetylation of PDC \\nplays an important role in promoting glycolysis and \\nsubsequent cancer cell proliferation. SIRT3 is the \\nupstream deacetylase of PDC that deacetylates and \\nactivates PDC to inhibit glycolysis and promote \\napoptosis in cancer cells [85]. In addition, SIRT3 could \\nstabilize p53 to inhibit glycolysis in wt-p53 cancer \\ncells. During this process, full-length SIRT3 can \\ninteract with PTEN in the nucleus to increase PTEN \\nactivity thus inhibiting MDM2 transcription, which is \\nresponsible for p53 degradation [86]. The stabilization \\nof p53 further impedes glycolysis via inhibition of the \\ntranscription of numerous key glycolytic enzymes \\n[87]. Moreover, SIRT3 can inhibit breast carcinoma \\nglycolysis through deacetylation and inactivation of \\ncyclophilin D. This further inhibits the binding of the \\nlactate metabolism enzyme hexokinase II (HK II) to \\nmitochondria to obstruct glycolysis [88]. Glutamate \\noxaloacetate transaminase 2 (GOT2), which is a \\nlimiting enzyme in regulating glycolysis processing, is \\ndeacetylated at Lys 159, 185, and 404 by SIRT3 thus \\ninhibiting GOT2 activity and hindering pancreatic \\ntumor growth [89]. Accordingly, in most glycolysis- \\naddiction cancers, SIRT3 activation will be beneficial \\nand SIRT3 activators might be candidate adjuvants. In \\naddition, SIRT3 directly or indirectly inhibits ROS- \\nregulated tumorigenesis and metastasis [90]. Of \\nwhich, SIRT3 represses ROS dependent Src/FAK \\nsignaling and promotes the proliferation, migration \\nand metastasis of cancer cells [91]. ROS elimination by \\nSIRT3 was also proven to contribute to the growth \\ninhibition of lung adenocarcinoma cells [92]. In \\nchronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), SIRT3 activates \\nMnSOD2 to eliminate ROS, thus inhibiting CLL \\nprogression [93]. Additionally, programmed cell \\ndeath induction is another strategy SIRT3 uses to \\ninhibit tumor progression. For instance, SIRT3 can \\nTheranostics 2020, Vol. 10, Issue 18 \\n \\n \\nhttp://www.thno.org \\n8322 \\nactivate glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) to \\npromote the Bax-regulated apoptosis pathway [94]. \\nSIRT3 up-regulation of MnSOD2 and p53 activity \\nfurther induced Bax- and Fas-regulated apoptosis in \\nHCC [95]. Moreover, SIRT3 plays a role in monitoring \\nthe stability of tumor genomes. Histone H3, which \\nparticipates in the reaction to DNA damage, can be \\ndeacetylated by SIRT3 at K56 to enhance DNA \\nnonhomologous \\nend \\njoining \\nrepair \\n[96]. \\n8- \\noxoguanine-DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) is a DNA \\nrepair enzyme that is important in the inhibition of \\ngenome damage. SIRT3 binds and blocks the \\ndegradation of OGG1 to inhibit tumorigenesis [97]. \\nOf \\nnote, \\nSIRT3 \\ncan \\nalso \\ninhibit \\ncancer \\nprogression by deacetylation of its substrate to \\nmodulate proliferation and migration. The F-box \\nprotein S-phase kinase associated protein 2 (Skp2) is a \\nproto-oncogene \\nwhich \\ninhibits \\nthe \\nactivity \\nof \\nnumerous tumor suppressor proteins (such as p21, \\np27 \\nand \\nE-cadherin) \\nvia \\nubiquitination \\nand \\ndestruction \\nto \\npositively \\nregulate \\ncell \\ncycle \\nprogression and migration, and negatively regulate \\napoptosis [98, 99]. Acetylation of Skp2 by histone \\nacetyltransferase p300 at Lys 68 and 71 will increase \\nits stability and cytoplasmic localization, which \\npromotes the degradation of E-cadherin. SIRT3 can \\ndirectly deacetylate Skp2 to prevent this process [100]. \\nSimilarly, Enoyl-CoA hydratase-1 (ECHS1) is also \\nhighly acetylated in cancer cells. Acetylation blocks \\nthe activity of ECHS1 and activates the mTOR- \\nregulated proliferation pathway. SIRT3 inhibits this \\nhyperacetylation \\nto \\nrestore \\nmitochondrial \\ntranslocation \\nand \\nECHS1 \\nactivity \\n[101]. \\nHyperacetylation \\nof \\nGlutamate \\noxaloacetate \\ntransaminases (GOT) promotes tumor growth while \\nSIRT3 reverses this process [89]. It has been shown in \\nrecent studies that in some highly malignant tumors, \\nthe activation of SIRT3 might be a possible treatment \\nmethod, especially for some drug-resistant cancers. \\nFor example, sorafenib is a well-known drug \\napproved for clinical use in hepatocellular carcinoma \\n(HCC), but is very prone to drug resistance, which \\nmakes its treatment of liver cancer less satisfactory. \\nInterestingly, studies revealed that sorafenib could \\ndecrease the expression of SIRT3, which contributes to \\nits reduced drug sensitivity, while up-regulation of \\nSIRT3 can re-sensitize HCC to sorafenib treatment \\n[102-104]. In addition, SIRT3 activation by ABT737 \\ncontributes to ameliorating cisplatin resistance in \\novarian cancer [105]. \\nOncogenic role of SIRT3 \\nThe tumor promoting effect of SIRT3 has also \\nbeen well studied, especially in some hematological \\nmalignancies that exhibit oxidative phosphorylation \\naddiction [77, 106]. IDH2 is a key enzyme acting in the \\nforward Krebs cycle and was identified as a hallmark \\nof hematological malignancies. SIRT3 can deacetylate \\nIDH2 \\nto \\nincrease \\nits \\nactivity \\nin \\npromoting \\ncarcinogenesis \\n[107]. \\nIn \\ndiffuse \\nlarge \\nB \\ncell \\nlymphomas \\n(DLBCLs), \\nSIRT3 \\nwas \\nproven \\nto \\naccelerate TCA cycle metabolism via enhancing GDH \\nactivity to promote lymphomagenesis [108]. Not \\nsurprisingly, SIRT3 has also been found to promote \\ntumor progression in some other cancers. In non- \\nsmall cell lung cancer, SIRT3 promotes the oncogenic \\nrole of NMNAT2 to stimulate cancer cell proliferation \\n[72]. Similarly, SIRT3 deacetylates p53 at Lys 320 and \\n382 to promote its degradation, thus hindering its \\ntumor inhibition role in PTEN-deficient non-small cell \\nlung cancer [109]. Therefore, in PTEN-deficient \\ntumors, SIRT3 inhibition might be a better treatment \\nstrategy. Recently, another study demonstrated that \\nSIRT3 could promote colorectal carcinogenesis. SIRT3 \\ndeacetylates \\nserine \\nhydroxymethyltransferase \\n2 \\n(SHMT2) at Lys 95 and inhibits its lysosome- \\ndependent degradation. Acetylated SHMT2 exhibits \\ndeficient \\nenzymatic \\nactivity, \\nwhich \\ninhibits \\ncarcinogenesis, while SIRT3 activates SHMT2 to \\npromote colorectal cancer cell proliferation [39]. In \\naddition, SIRT3 can increase SOD2 activity to \\nproperly regulate ROS production to prevent \\napoptosis [110]. In ovarian cancer cells, SIRT3 \\nfine-tunes SOD2 activity to adapt to cellular stress and \\nanoikis resistance in order to ensure cell survival \\n[111]. Interestingly, the activation of SOD2 mediated \\nby \\nSIRT3 \\ncan \\npromote \\nepithelial-mesenchymal \\ntransition (EMT) in triple negative breast cancer \\n(TNBC) cells [25]. In cervical cancer cells, SIRT3 \\ndeacetylates Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1) to \\npromote lipid metabolism. This fatty acid metabolism \\nreprogramming promotes cancer migration and \\ninvasion [112]. Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 \\n(PYCR1) is another substrate of SIRT3. Acetylation at \\nLys 228 suppresses tumor proliferation, while \\ndeacetylation by SIRT3 promotes breast cancer cell \\nand lung cancer cell survival [113]. Accordingly, we \\nshould be thoughtful in trying to regulate SIRT3 for \\ncancer therapy. \\nOverall, \\nSIRT3 \\nis \\ncapable \\nof \\nmetabolic \\nreprogramming and contributes greatly in the fate of \\ncancers (Figure 4). Highly acetylated modifications \\nfrequently occur in cancer, which is conducive to the \\nsurvival of most tumors. SIRT3 regulates tumor \\nprogression by changing this excessive modification \\nback to a normal condition. The role of SIRT3 in \\ncancer is a double-edged sword which to some extent \\nincreases the confusion and risk of SIRT3 as a target \\nfor cancer treatment. More regrettably, there are no \\nsatisfactory SIRT3 activators or inhibitors that have \\nTheranostics 2020, Vol. 10, Issue 18 \\n \\n \\nhttp://www.thno.org \\n8323 \\nbeen developed successfully for cancer therapy, \\nwhich makes recognition of SIRT3 as a druggable \\ntarget in cancer more difficult and questionable. Even \\nso, we believe it is a promising drug target in cancer if \\nwe can intelligently regulate it in personalized \\ntherapy. \\nSIRT3 in heart disease \\nHeart disease is one of the most common \\ndiseases and one of the biggest killers in the field of \\nhuman health [97]. The role of the heart is to \\nencourage blood flow, provide sufficient blood to \\norgans and tissues to supply oxygen and various \\nnutrients, and remove metabolic products to maintain \\nmetabolism and homeostasis. The normal work of the \\nheart requires huge amounts of energy production \\nand consumption, which is mainly provided by the \\nmitochondria \\n[114]. \\nThe \\nnormal \\nfunction \\nof \\nmitochondria as energy-producing engines is the \\nbasis of the normal function of the heart. Conversely, \\nthe dysfunction of mitochondria directly or indirectly \\ncontributes to the progression of a series of heart \\ndiseases, among which are heart failure, cardiac \\nhypertrophy, \\natherosclerosis, \\nand \\ndilated \\ncardiomyopathy [115, 116]. As an eminent guardian of \\nmitochondrial homeostasis, SIRT3 also plays an \\nirreplaceable role in heart disease. Loss of SIRT3 \\nimpairs the contractile function of the heart [117], and \\nin \\na \\nlater \\nstudy \\nSIRT3 \\nwas \\nfound \\nto \\nbe \\ndown-regulated in heart failure. In this process, \\nmiR-195 targets SIRT3 to inhibit its expression thus \\ndisturbing oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in the \\nmyocardial energy \\nmetabolism imbalance \\n[31]. \\nAnother study reported that rarefaction of cardiac \\nmicrovessels and functional hypoxia are more likely \\nto occur in SIRT3-KO mice than WT mice. And \\n \\n \\nFigure 4. SIRT3 in cancer. SIRT3 plays a two-sided role in cancer. In most cancers, SIRT3 plays a tumor suppressor role. On the one hand, SIRT3 can maintain the stability \\nof the cancer genome and inhibit carcinogenesis. On the other hand, SIRT3 inhibits the Warburg effect of cancer to inhibit the development of tumors. In addition, SIRT3 can \\ninhibit tumor proliferation and metastasis. SIRT3 induced apoptosis and autophagy also involved in this progress. However, in some colorectal cancers and lung cancers, SIRT3 \\nplays an oncogenic role by promoting proliferation and metastasis via deacetylation of specific substrates. The pink protein represents the substrate for SIRT3. Gray circles \\nrepresent acetylation modifications. \\nTheranostics 2020, Vol. 10, Issue 18 \\n \\n \\nhttp://www.thno.org \\n8324 \\nSIRT3-KO \\nmice \\nexhibit \\ndistinct \\nmitochondrial \\ndysfunction and enhanced cardiac fibrosis marker \\nexpression [118]. Moreover, SIRT3-KO mice exhibited \\ndiastolic dysfunction and decreased angiogenesis \\n[119]. Remarkably, SIRT3 deletion mice are more \\nsusceptible to a high-fat diet and exhibit higher ROS \\nproduction and lower cardiac function [120]. In \\naddition, SIRT3 can inhibit arterial thrombosis by \\nsuppressing \\nneutrophil \\nextracellular \\ntraps \\nand \\ndecreasing plasma tissue factor activity [121]. More \\ninterestingly, a study found that acetylation of \\nmitochondrial \\nproteins \\nmostly \\noccurs \\nnon-\\nenzymatically and SIRT3 just modifies the acetylation \\nback to the normal level. A more prominent role of \\nSIRT3 is to remove acetylation lesions on its \\nsubstrates, such as at Lys 127 on Glycine N- \\nacyltransferase \\n(GLYAT) \\nand \\nat \\nLys \\n48 \\non \\nhydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA \\nlyase \\n(HMGCL), \\nto \\nprotect metabolic fidelity [122]. In this section we will \\nmainly discuss how SIRT3 regulates its substrates to \\ncarry out its heart protector role (Figure 5). \\nThe first protective effect of SIRT3 on the heart is \\nto increase the energy production of mitochondria. \\nSIRT3 can activate mitochondrial complex I and \\nenhance \\nthe \\nETC \\nfunction \\nto \\nmaintain \\nATP \\nhomeostasis \\n[123]. \\nATP5O \\nand \\nATP5A1, \\ntwo \\nmitochondrial ATP synthases, can be deacetylated by \\nSIRT3 to enhance ATP production [19, 124]. In \\naddition, SIRT3 actives the LKB1-AMPK pathway to \\ngenerate ATP [125]. Optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), another \\ntarget of SIRT3, can be triggered by SIRT3 to improve \\ncardiac mitochondrial bioenergetics [126]. In addition, \\nSIRT3 can regulate a series of substrates to block \\ncardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy is a stress \\nadaptive response to a range of heart conditions, but it \\nalso increases mortality and the risk of heart disease. \\nThus, inhibiting hypertrophy may be beneficial to the \\nheart. Of note, Rho/Rho kinase signaling, mTOR \\nsignaling, ROS signaling are three key villains of \\ncardiac hypertrophy [127]. Of note, the LKB1-AMPK \\npathway is the upstream negative regulator of mTOR \\nsignaling, and \\nSIRT3 can active \\nLKB1-AMPK \\nsignaling \\nto \\ninhibit \\nmTOR \\nregulated \\nprotein \\nsynthesis, which inhibits cardiac hypertrophy [125]. \\nMore interestingly, the SIRT3 substrate FOXO3α not \\nonly functions well in regulating apoptosis and \\nautophagy, but also it regulates mTOR and Rho/Rho \\nkinase signaling [128, 129]. SIRT3 can active the \\n \\n \\nFigure 5. SIRT3 in heart disease. Heart disease often manifests as dysfunction of cardiomyocytes, such as local hypoxia, death of cardiomyocytes, fibrosis, and the like. \\nDysfunction of cardiomyocytes ultimately leads to myocardial ischemia, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure. SIRT3 can increase the mitochondrial function of cardiomyocytes and \\nincrease energy production by deacetylating its substrate. In addition, SIRT3 can deacetylate its substrates to inhibit AKT-mTOR/ERK1/2/TGF-β-smad3-induced myocardial \\nfibrosis. During this process, SIRT3 can also activate GSK-3β to contribute to myocardial fibrosis inhibition. SIRT3 also directly inhibits cardiomyocytes apoptosis. Last but not \\nthe least, SIRT3 can eliminate ROS and activate mitophagy to inhibit cardiac remodeling. The pink protein represents the substrate for SIRT3. Gray circles represent acetylation \\nmodifications. \\nTheranostics 2020, Vol. 10, Issue 18 \\n \\n \\nhttp://www.thno.org \\n8325 \\nactivity and nuclear translocation of FOXO3α, thereby \\ninhibiting mTOR and Rho/Rho kinase signaling and \\npreventing cardiac hypertrophy. To inhibit ROS \\nregulated signaling, SIRT3 can directly deacetylate, \\nactivate \\nMnSOD2 \\nand \\noligomycin-sensitivity \\nconferring protein (OSCP), inhibiting the synthesis \\nand aggregation of ROS, thus preventing cardiac \\nhypertrophy [16]. Cyclophilin D (CypD), which is an \\nintegral part of the mitochondrial permeability \\ntransition pore (mPTP), can be deacetylated by SIRT3 \\nat lysine 166 to prevent the opening of mPTP, thus \\ninhibiting stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy and \\napoptosis \\n[58]. \\nHypertrophy-related \\nlipid \\naccumulation \\nis \\nanother \\nproblem \\nof \\ncardiac \\nhypertrophy, which will further lead to heart failure. \\nSIRT3 could downregulate the acetylation of long- \\nchain acyl CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) to restore \\nlipid metabolism homeostasis [130]. In addition, \\nNicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 3 \\n(NMNAT3), can also bind to SIRT3 and be \\ndeacetylated. Deacetylation of NMNAT3 enhances its \\nenzyme activity and in-turn promotes the anti- \\nhypertrophic effects of SIRT3 [131]. \\nCardiac \\nfibrosis \\nis \\nanother \\npathological \\nmanifestation of cardiac remodeling in heart disease. \\nSIRT3 can ameliorate cardiac fibrosis through \\nblocking the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway [132]. SIRT3 can \\ndeacetylate glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) at \\nresidue Lys 15 to promote GSK3β activity. The \\nactivation of GSK3β thereby resists TGF-β/Smad3 \\nregulated fibrotic genes expression [133]. Moreover, \\nsignal transducer and activator of transcription 3 \\n(STAT3) can be deacetylated by SIRT3 to inhibit \\nSTAT3-NFATc2 regulated fibrosis [134]. Also the role \\nof SIRT3 in eliminating ROS also helps the SIRT3/ \\nROS/ERK1/2 cascade inhibit cardiac remodeling \\n[135]. In addition, the role of SIRT3-induced \\nautophagy and apoptosis inhibition in heart disease \\nshould not be ignored. Parkin-dependent mitosis \\ninduced by SIRT3 can clear damaged mitochondria \\nand prevent the remodeling of hypertensive heart and \\nthe death of myocardial cells [65]. Ku70, another \\nsubstrate of SIRT3, can be deacetylated and activated \\nby SIRT3. After deacetylation, Ku70 interacts with Bax \\nto inhibit the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes [136]. \\nSIRT3 can protect cardiomyocytes by inhibiting \\napoptosis through deacetylating p53. As mentioned \\nabove, SIRT3 has a wide protective role in heart \\ndisease, and targeting SIRT3 can be a new strategy for \\nthe treatment of heart disease. It is gratifying that the \\nSIRT3 activator honokiol has been proven to have \\ncardioprotective effects [16, 137], which also provides \\nevidence for SIRT3 as a druggable target for \\nimproving heart disease. \\nSIRT3 in metabolic disease \\nMetabolic diseases generally have a long course \\nover which energy metabolism, glycometabolism, \\nfatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism \\ngradually become out of balance. Eventually this \\nleads to obesity, diabetes, liver disease, and kidney \\ndisease [138]. The kidney is a highly energy- \\nconsuming organ because it not only removes \\nmetabolites from the body by generating urine, but \\nalso maintains the balance between water and \\nelectrolytes. Additionally, it secretes some active \\nsubstances, such as erythropoietin and active vitamin \\nD3 to promote the growth and development of the \\nbody [139]. The kidney is rich in mitochondria in \\norder \\nto \\nsatisfy \\nits \\nenergy \\nneeds, \\nand \\nthe \\nmitochondrion is a highly mobile organelle that can \\nchange its position and numbers as needed [140]. \\nSIRT3, as a key regulator of mitochondrial dynamics, \\nplays an important role in the energy supply of renal \\ncells [141]. The overexpression of SIRT3 can improve \\nkidney function, attenuate oxidative injury, and \\nsuppress the inflammatory damage and apoptosis of \\nrenal tubular epithelial cells [142]. The absence of \\nSIRT3 expression will aggravate acute renal injury \\n(AKI), and increase ROS levels and apoptosis. \\nActivation of SIRT3 decreases the acetylation of \\nCypD, thereby inhibiting mitochondrial damage of \\nAKI, and thus protecting the kidneys [143, 144]. \\nActivation of SIRT3 also inhibits the acetylation of p53 \\nwhich blocks apoptosis in AKI [145]. In addition, \\nSIRT3 \\ndeacetylates \\nPGC1-α \\nand \\nmitochondrial \\ncomplex I to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and \\nenergy \\ngenerating \\nfor \\nresisting \\nAKI \\n[139]. \\nNephrolithiasis is a form of kidney metabolic disease \\nand its main cause is damage to renal epithelial cells \\nfrom calcium oxalate. A recent study found that \\nnephrolithiasis-afflicted \\nmice \\nalways \\nexhibit \\na \\nsignificant reduction in SIRT3 expression. SIRT3 could \\ndeacetylate \\nFOXO3a \\nthus \\nactivating \\nit. \\nAfter \\ndeacetylation, FOXO3a binds with the promoter of \\nLC3 to induce autophagy and suppress renal tubular \\nepithelial cell injury [146]. Additionally, the SIRT3 \\nregulated NRF2/HO-1 pathway may also contribute \\nto inhibiting the formation of kidney stones [147]. \\nFurthermore, SIRT3 can inhibit renal fibrosis. \\nEndothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) has \\nemerged as an important contributor to renal fibrosis. \\nMice with SIRT3 loss more easily develop renal \\ndysfunction with increased ROS production and \\nEndoMT. Interestingly, SIRT3 can activate FOXO3a to \\ninhibit this progress [148]. SIRT3 can also inhibit renal \\nfibrosis by deacetylation and activation of GSK3 β to \\ninhibit the expression of fibrosis genes [133]. \\nLiraglutide can protect the kidney from diabetic \\nnephropathy, while deletion of SIRT3 abrogated its \\nTheranostics 2020, Vol. 10, Issue 18 \\n \\n \\nhttp://www.thno.org \\n8326 \\nkidney protection effect [31]. Optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), \\na regulator of mitochondrial fusion, can be up- \\nregulated by SIRT3, which subsequently enhances the \\nfusion of renal mitochondria and improve the \\nproduction of kidney energy [142]. In short, SIRT3 can \\nprotect the kidney from metabolic disease. \\nLiver is the main metabolic organ of the human \\nbody. It governs the metabolism of glucose, protein, \\nfat and carbohydrates. Also, it is also the largest \\ndetoxification organ in the human body. Abnormal \\nliver metabolism will induce a series of hepatic \\nmetabolic diseases, of which fatty liver is the most \\ncommon. SIRT3 is always down-regulated in patients \\nwith fatty liver [149-151]. SIRT3 overexpression can \\nrestore liver function, inhibit inflammation and \\napoptosis, and alleviate liver fibrosis. SIRT3 activates \\nERK-CREB signaling to promote BNIP3 activity, thus \\ninducing BNIP3 regulated mitotic resistance to \\nnonalcoholic fatty liver disease [31]. SIRT3-induced \\nautophagy can also protect the liver from alcohol- \\ninduced injury [152]. However, there are often two \\nsides to complex issues. Another study demonstrated \\nthat, in contrast, SIRT3 could be a negative regulator \\nof autophagy, which can lead to NAFLD induced by \\nlipotoxicity [153]. More interestingly, SIRT3 can \\nrepress hepatitis caused by infection with the \\nHepatitis B virus (HBV). In a recent study, SIRT3 was \\nfound to aggregate in the covalently closed circular \\nDNA (cccDNA) of HBV and deacetylate Lys 9 of \\nHistone H3, inhibiting HBV transcription and \\nreplication [154]. As it does in other organs, SIRT3 can \\nenhance ROS clearance to protect liver from oxidative \\ndamage by activating MnSOD2 and FOXO3a. Also \\nSIRT3 \\nprotects \\nhepatocytes \\nby \\ninhibiting \\nmitochondrial \\ndamage \\nand \\napoptosis \\nthrough \\ndeacetylation of Ku70 [155, 156]. In addition, SIRT3 \\ncan alleviate liver fibrosis. The deacetylation and \\nactivation of GSK3β at Lys 15 by SIRT3 inhibit the \\nexpression of fibrosis genes in the liver [133]. ROS \\npromotes liver fibrosis through AKT-mTOR and \\nERK1/2 signaling, while SIRT3 resists liver fibrosis by \\neliminating harmful ROS. SIRT3 is definitely a liver \\nprotector by safeguarding metabolic stability. \\nObesity and diabetes are becoming ever more \\ncommon around the world and are now trending with \\nyounger people. Although a recent study suggests \\nthat SIRT3 is dispensable in adipocyte metabolism \\nand obesity-induced metabolic complications [157], \\nSIRT3 in fact is important in obesity and diabetes. Of \\nnote, insulin resistance and vascular dysfunction are \\ncommon in obese patients, which are exacerbated by \\nSIRT3 deficiency [158, 159]. SIRT3 can regulate \\nendothelial cell glycolytic metabolism, and mice \\nlacking the expression of SIRT3 will increase insulin \\nresistance because of the dysfunction of glucose \\nuptake and mitochondrial function [119, 160]. In \\naddition, SIRT3 can protect endothelial cells from \\nmitochondrial ROS damage and increase NO release \\nto benefit vasodilatation [159]. Moreover, SIRT3- \\nmediated SOD2 deacetylation also contributes to \\nmaintaining the escape of endothelial progenitor cells \\n(EPCs) from dysfunction and injury as well as \\ndecreased vascular inflammation [161, 162]. Maternal \\nobesity is another key problem in human beings. The \\nresulting high oxidative stress and meiotic defects of \\noocytes will damage reproductive health. Activation \\n7of SIRT3 can attenuate oxidative damage and \\nimprove the oocyte quality in obese woman [163]. Of \\nnote, the deficiency of SIRT3 causes pancreatic beta \\ncells to be more sensitive to cellular stress and \\noxidative damage, impairs their function and \\npromotes \\nthe \\ndevelopment \\nof \\ndiabetes \\n[164]. \\nActivation of SIRT3 can also regulate skeletal muscle \\nmetabolism and activate insulin signaling to improve \\ndiabetes. In this process, SIRT3 removes ROS to \\ninhibit the activation of JNK and ISR-1 [165]. \\nInterestingly, \\nactivation \\nof \\npro-inflammatory \\nmacrophages is fateful in the pathogenesis of insulin \\nresistance in diabetes. Loss of SIRT3 leads to the \\nincreasing expression of inflammatory cytokines and \\nhigh risk of diabetes [166]. Pyruvate dehydrogenase \\n(PDH) is a key regulator in the TCA cycle and glucose \\noxidation. SIRT3 can deacetylate its E1α subunit to \\nincrease its enzymatic activity [167]. SIRT3 also \\npromotes HKII-VDAC-ANT complex formation to \\nimprove glucose control [168]. As it does in other \\ndiseases, SIRT3 activates MnSOD2 and IDH2 to \\nremove harmful ROS and activates FOXO3a to induce \\ncell-protective autophagy to improve obesity and \\ndiabetes. Thus, SIRT3 protects human from metabolic \\ndiseases (Figure 6), and SIRT3 modulators will shine \\nin the prevention and early treatment of metabolic \\ndiseases. \\nSIRT3 in other diseases \\nIn addition to several major diseases, SIRT3 \\noffers protection from other common diseases and \\nimproves the quality of human life. SIRT3 can \\nmaintain \\nbone \\nmetabolism \\nby \\nenhancing \\nthe \\nAMPK-PGC-1β axis [169]. SIRT3 can also protect \\nmicrovasculature from LPS-induced damage. LPS \\nupregulates Ang-2, leading to vascular leakage, while \\nSIRT3 inhibits the expression of Ang-2 to maintain \\nvascular integrity [170]. Up-regulation of SIRT3 can \\nattenuate endothelial cellular senescence to decrease \\nthe risk of atherosclerosis [171]. In addition, activation \\nof SIRT3 can suppress osteoarthritis by maintaining \\nmitochondrial metabolism stability [172]. Overall, \\nSIRT3 is very important in maintaining human health \\nand proper regulation of SIRT3 will be beneficial to \\nTheranostics 2020, Vol. 10, Issue 18 \\n \\n \\nhttp://www.thno.org \\n8327 \\nhuman health. \\nTargeting SIRT3 for potential therapies \\nAs a result of the importance of SIRT3 in various \\ndiseases, several SIRT3 regulatory compounds have \\nbeen discovered or designed synthetically. These \\ncompounds can deacetylate SIRT3 or regulate its \\nexpression level through different mechanisms. Based \\non their influence on SIRT3, these compounds were \\ndivided into two broad categories, SIRT3 activators \\n(strictly \\nspeaking, \\n“positive \\nmodulators”) \\nand \\ninhibitors. In this section we will discuss these \\ncompounds, the related mechanisms and potential \\ntherapeutic implications. \\nPositive modulators of SIRT3 \\nSIRT3 dysfunction is closely related to the \\noccurrence and development of various diseases, and \\nactivation of SIRT3 appears to be an effective strategy \\nfor the treatment of many diseases. Unfortunately, to \\ndate SIRT3 agonist has ever been reported to date. \\nSeveral positive modulators of SIRT3 were reported, \\nwhich can stimulate SIRT3 by elevating SIRT3 \\nexpression. By upregulating SIRT3, they have \\ndisplayed promising therapeutic effects in some \\ndiseases such as cardiac hypertrophy, acute kidney \\ninjury, and others (Table 3). Of note, most positive \\nregulators of SIRT3 are derived from natural \\nproducts. For instance, Honokiol is one of the most \\nstudied SIRT3 activators and is a natural lignan \\n \\n \\nFigure 6. SIRT3 in metabolic disease. The body's energy metabolism, glycometabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism are generally imbalanced in \\nmetabolic diseases. SIRT3 can regulate a series of substrates to maintain the metabolic balance and stability of different organisms, and inhibit the occurrence and development \\nof metabolic diseases. In addition, SIRT3 can inhibit the fibrosis of each organ and protect its normal function. It is worth noting that SIRT3 is also involved in the fight against viral \\ninfections and inflammatory responses. The pink protein represents the substrate for SIRT3. Gray circles represent acetylation modifications. \\nTheranostics 2020, Vol. 10, Issue 18 \\n \\n \\nhttp://www.thno.org \\n8328 \\nderived from the bark of Magnolia. Honokiol could \\nincrease SIRT3 expression and deacetylation activity, \\nwhich have a favorable effect on heart disease [16, \\n137], renal disease [173], surgery/anesthesia-induced \\ncognitive decline [174] and Vitiligo [175]. For heart \\ndisease, Honokiol activation of SIRT3 further \\ndecreases the acetylation levels of MnSOD2 and \\nOSCP, resulting in improved mitochondrial rate of \\noxygen consumption and inhibition of ROS synthesis. \\nIn \\naddition, \\nHonokiol \\nsuppresses \\ncardiac \\nhypertrophy and fibrosis via SIRT3-regulated AKT \\nand ERK1/2 inhibition in mice with cardiac \\nhypertrophy \\n[16]. \\nFurthermore, \\nin \\nmice \\nwith \\ndoxorubicin-induced \\ncardiomyopathy, \\nHonokiol \\nactivated SIRT3 to promote mitochondrial fusion and \\ninhibit apoptosis. More intriguingly, activation of \\nSIRT3 by Honokiol can protect against doxorubicin- \\ninduced cardiotoxicity in tumor-xenograft mice \\nwithout affecting the anti-tumor effect of doxorubicin. \\nThis makes it possible for Honokiol to contribute to \\nadjuvant therapy of chemotherapy [137]. In renal \\ndisease, Honokiol stimulates SIRT3 activity to block \\nthe NF-κB-TGF- β1/Smad regulated inflammation \\nand fibrosis signaling in renal fibrosis mice model \\n[173]. Surprisingly, Honokiol can ameliorate surgery- \\ninduced or anesthesia-induced cognitive decline in \\nmice via SIRT3 activation mediating ROS elimination \\nand apoptosis inhibition [174]. Interestingly, honokiol \\ncould improve vitiligo via melanocyte apoptosis \\ninhibition through SIRT3-OPA1 axis activation [175]. \\nThese studies suggest that Honokiol may be helpful in \\nthe treatment of various diseases, whether used alone \\nor as an adjunct therapy. Silybin is another natural \\nplant-derived SIRT3 activator. It is isolated from the \\nseeds of blessed milkthistle (Silybum marianum) and \\nis used as a hepatoprotectant in traditional Chinese \\nmedicine. It was reported that Silybin can improve \\nkidney mitochondrial function via activating SIRT3 in \\na mouse model of cisplatin-induced acute kidney \\ninjury. Up-regulation of SIRT3 eliminates ROS and \\ninhibits apoptosis to protect kidney cells from death. \\nIt is noteworthy that this protective effect can decrease \\ncisplatin-induced renal toxicity and may contribute to \\nclinical adjuvant treatment in cisplatin chemotherapy \\n[176]. Resveratrol, a famous SIRT1 activator (although \\nresveratrol-mediated activation of sirtuins has been \\nrepeatedly shown to be an experimental artifact, it \\ndoes have biological activity in vivo), can also increase \\nthe expression of SIRT3 to attenuate acute kidney \\ninjury [177]. Fascinatingly, Dihydromyricetin has a \\nsimilar chemical structure to Resveratrol and it can \\nelevate the expression of SIRT3 through SIRT3 \\nmediated cytoprotection and inflammatory resistance, \\nthus treating osteoarthritis [172]. Polydatin, a \\npolyphenolic compound isolated from Polygonum \\ncuspidatum, can initiate SIRT3-regulated mitochon-\\ndrial autophagy to protect cardiomyocytes from \\nmyocardial infarction [178]. Moreover, in a mouse \\nmodel of sulfur mustard-induced hepatic injury, this \\nnatural product exerts its hepatoprotective effects via \\nSIRT3 [179]. Pyrroloquinoline quinone, another \\nnatural product, can improve liver metabolic diseases \\nthrough increasing the expression of SIRT3 [180]. \\nImportantly, a growing number of reports show \\nthat some “old drugs” have a capacity of activating \\nSIRT3 with a clear action mechanism. Metformin is a \\nknown AMPK activator which applied as the first-line \\ndrug for type 2 diabetes. Metformin can improve \\natherosclerosis aroused by type 2 diabetes via up- \\nregulating SIRT3 [181]. Hearing loss is a common age- \\nrelated disease with cell degeneration. The Cl- channel \\nblocker, Adjudin, prevents gentamicin-induced hair \\ncell loss via SIRT3 [182]. Interestingly, a hormone \\nnamed Melatonin, which targets the melatonin \\nreceptor to play a role in sleep, now has been found to \\nbe a SIRT3 activator that plays a protective role in \\nheart \\ndisease \\n[183], \\nliver \\ninjury \\n[184] \\nand \\natherosclerosis [185]. In a mouse model of myocardial \\nischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury, melatonin also \\nincreases SIRT3 expression and activity to inhibit \\napoptosis of cardiomyocytes and maintain the \\nstability of mitochondrial metabolism [183]. In \\naddition, in cadmium-induced hepatotoxicity in vitro \\nand in vivo models, melatonin enhances the activity of \\nSIRT3 \\nto \\ninhibit \\nboth \\nROS \\nproduction \\nand \\ncadmium-triggered autophagic cell death [184]. \\nAdditionally, in a mouse model of atherosclerosis, \\nmelatonin activates SIRT3-FOXO3a-Parkin regulated \\nmitophagy \\nto \\nprevent \\ninflammation \\nand \\natherosclerotic progression [185]. \\nAnother \\ntype \\nof \\nSIRT3 \\nactivator \\nis \\na \\nsubstrate-dependent \\nactivator. \\n7-hydroxy-3-(4'- \\nmethoxyphenyl) coumarin (C12) is a compound that \\npromotes the deacetylation of MnSODK68AcK \\n(MnSOD acetylated at Lys 68) through SIRT3. C12 \\nwas identified based on the crystal structure of \\nMnSODK68AcK. C12 binds to the MnSODK68AcK- \\nSIRT3 complex and promotes the deacetylation and \\nactivation of MnSOD. The Kd value of C12 binds to \\nSIRT3 is 3.9 μM and the 50% activation concentration \\nis 75.78 μM towards MnSODK68AcK [15]. Of note, \\namong all these SIRT3 activators, C12 is closest to the \\nreal SIRT3 activator. \\nAs a fascinating target for disease treatment, \\nSIRT3 has always been a research hotspot. Although \\nthese positive modulators of SIRT3 have certain \\ntherapeutic potentials for disease, the design of \\ntargeted small-molecule activators of SIRT3 still faces \\nsignificant challenges. \\nTheranostics 2020, Vol. 10, Issue 18 \\n \\n \\nhttp://www.thno.org \\n8329 \\nTable 3.

On the other hand, NAD+ coenzyme \\ncompetitive inhibitors can accelerate the reverse \\nreaction of deacetylation to inhibit the progress of the \\ndeacetylate reaction. Notably, it is easy to achieve \\nconsiderable satisfactory inhibition efficiency and \\nselectivity \\nwith \\nthe \\ncatalytic \\nmechanism-based \\ninhibitors. This is the fascinating characteristic of this \\ntype of SIRT3 inhibitor and, of course, why it is one of \\nthe most studied. \\nSubstrate Competitive SIRT3 Inhibitors \\nThe most common and effective inhibitor design \\nstrategies \\nuse \\nsubstrate \\ncompetitive \\ninhibitors. \\n4’-bromo-resveratrol is an ACS2 peptide substrate \\ncompetitive inhibitor discovered in 2013 [188]. \\nRecently, 4’-bromo-resveratrol was found to inhibit \\nmelanoma \\nprogression \\nvia \\nSIRT3 \\nmediated \\nmitochondrial metabolic reprogramming. In this \\nprocess, 4’-bromo-resveratrol was also confirmed to \\ninduce apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest [189]. \\nSimon \\net \\nal. \\ndiscovered \\na \\npeptide \\nsubstrate \\ncompetitive SIRT1/2 inhibitor, cambinol, which has a \\npotential effect on cancer treatment. After that, they \\ndesigned a series of cambinol analogues and \\ndiscovered the SIRT3 selective inhibitor 4- [(2- \\nHydroxy-6-phenylnaphthalen-1-yl) \\nmethyl]-5-(4- \\nmethylphenyl) -2, 3-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-3-one (SIRT3 \\nIC50 = 6 μM) that has good anti-cancer potential [190]. \\nAnalogs of NƐ-acyl-lysine are important substrate \\ncompetitive SIRT3 inhibitors. Peptide-based SIRT3 \\ninhibitors are one of the analogs of NƐ-acyl-lysine with \\nexcellent proteolytic stability and cell permeability. \\nChen et al. designed a series of peptides containing \\nNƐ-thioacetyl-lysine that exhibit SIRT1/2/3 inhibition \\neffects. Their effects vary from 0.47 μM to 10.8 μM and \\nthe most potent one can efficiently inhibit SIRTs \\nactivity in HCT116 human colon cancer cells. \\nUnfortunately, despite its acceptable SIRT3 inhibitory \\nactivity, this one is not a selective SIRT3 inhibitor \\n(SIRT3 IC50 = 0.22 μM; SIRT3 IC50 = 0.24 μM; SIRT3 \\nIC50 = 0.47 μM) [191]. This also suggests that if we \\nwant to develop specific substrate-competitive SIRT3 \\ninhibitors, we may need to select SIRT3-specific \\nsubstrate action sites for targeted design. Zheng et al. \\nalso designed a variety of potent SIRT3 tripeptidic \\ninhibitors containing NƐ-thioacetyl-lysine. However, \\ntheir selectivity was generally not strong [192]. \\nSIRT3-selective inhibitors can be obtained from other \\nSIRT inhibitors by classical medicinal chemistry \\nmethods [108]. One case in point is the thioacyl lysine \\ncompound TM reported by Hui Jing et al. It was \\nidentified as targeting SIRT2 with little SIRT3 \\ninhibition. 3-hydroxy substitution (generating JH-T4) \\nremarkably enhances SIRT3 inhibition with an IC50 of \\n2.5 μM. Considering the fact that SIRT3 is abundant in \\nmitochondria, \\nresearchers \\nmodified \\nJH-T4 \\nby \\nreplacing the benzyl carbamoyl group with a \\ntriphenylphosphonium (TPP) mitochondrial targeting \\nmoiety to obtain the compound YC8-02, which \\nachieved superior penetration into mitochondria. \\nAccordingly, the SIRT3 IC50 was further increased to \\n0.53 μM. YC8-02 not only exhibits strong SIRT3 \\ninhibition effects, but also inhibits lymphomagenesis \\nby selectively inhibiting SIRT3 (Figure 8A) [108]. \\nNicotinamide Competitive SIRT3 Inhibitors \\nNicotinamide is an endogenous inhibitor of \\nSIRTs, but the one major drawback is that it has no \\nselectivity for SIRTs. However, it is undeniable that \\nnicotinamide analogues are an important component \\nof \\nSIRT3 \\ninhibitors. \\n3-TYP \\nis \\nessentially \\na \\nnicotinamide analogue which is a widely used tool in \\nmedicine with high selective SIRT3 inhibition (SIRT3 \\nIC50=16 nM) [193]. EX-527 is a selective SIRTs \\ninhibitor \\nthat \\nfunctions \\nby \\noccupying \\nthe \\nnicotinamide site and neighboring pocket contacting \\nNAD+. EX-527 always been defied as a SIRT1 \\ninhibitor, but it can also inhibit SIRT3 with weak \\nactivity (SIRT3 IC50=49 μM) [194]. Interestingly, the \\ndiscovery of EX-527 revealed a new SIRT inhibition \\nmechanism, namely, the formation of trimer Sirtuin \\ncomplex with a NAD+-derived coproduct. \\nStructure-based SIRT3 Inhibitors \\nDocking and binding free energy calculations are \\nmethods to discover novel SIRT3 inhibitors based on \\nits reported structure. In this way, Berin et al. \\ndiscovered a fair number of compounds that exhibit \\nfine SIRT3 inhibition effects. Unfortunately, their \\nbiological activity has not been detected, so their \\napplication may require more work to support [195]. \\nChemical Library Screening-based SIRT3 Inhibitors \\nChemical library screening is an effective way to \\ndiscover novel SIRT3 inhibitors. Recently, the novel \\nSIRT3 inhibitor 77-39 (SIRT3 IC50 = 4.5 μM) was \\ndiscovered through the DNA-encoded Dynamic \\nChemical Library (Figure 8B). 77-39 also exhibits \\nexcellent cellular SIRT3 inhibition activity, which \\nincreases the global mitochondrial acetylation level of \\nHeLa cells. Moreover, 77-39 showed only little \\nTheranostics 2020, Vol. 10, Issue 18 \\n \\n \\nhttp://www.thno.org \\n8336 \\ncytotoxicity [194]. Encoded Library Technology \\nscreening is another efficient strategy to identify novel \\nSIRT3 inhibitors. Through this strategy, the potent \\nSIRT3 inhibitor 11c ((N2-(2-(1-(6-carbamoylthieno [3, \\n2-d] \\npyrimidin-4-yl) \\npiperidin-4-yl) \\nethyl)-N5- \\nethylthiophene-2, 5-dicarboxamide)) (SIRT3 IC50 = 4.0 \\nnM) was discovered (Figure 8C) [197]. \\nOther SIRT3 Inhibitors \\nTenovin-6 is a p53 activator with biological \\nactivity that later was also found to be a SIRT3 \\ninhibitor (SIRT3 IC50 = 67 μM) with anti-tumor \\nactivity. The inhibitory effect on SIRT3 was unclear, \\nbut it has been proven to act as a non-competitive \\ninhibitor [186]. LC-0296 is a synthetic SIRT3 inhibitor \\nwith good inhibitory effect (SIRT3 IC50 = 3.6 μM) and \\nits mechanism is also unclear. Judging by its structure, \\nLC-0296 might be a NAD+ competitive inhibitor. It \\nhas good activity against squamous cell carcinoma of \\nthe head and neck through inhibiting proliferation \\nand promoting apoptosis [198]. Trimethylamine-N- \\noxide (TMAO) is a choline metabolite that can \\npromote vascular inflammation through SIRT3 \\ninhibition-induced \\nROS-NLRP3 \\nactivation \\n[199]. \\nAlbendazole \\nis \\nan \\nanthelmintic \\ndrug \\nwith \\nmicrotubule-targeting ability. Recently, albendazole \\nwas found to induce SIRT3 degradation to inhibit \\nleukemia cell survival [187]. 2-methoxyestradiol \\n(2-ME) is an anti-cancer drug, which has been found \\nto bind to the typical and allosteric inhibitor binding \\nsites on SIRT3 to inhibit its activity. By inhibiting \\nSIRT3, 2-ME can disturb normal mitochondrial \\nfunctions and kill osteosarcoma cells [200]. \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 8.

The application of SIRT3 \\ninhibitors is something that requires more attention. \\nGiven the cytoprotective role of SIRT3 in multiple \\norgans, inhibition of SIRT3 in certain cancers should \\nbe carefully evaluated and discussed. Therefore, how \\nto develop a highly efficient SIRT3 inhibitor without \\norgan toxicity is widely expected. In addition, the \\nintroduction of new drug delivery methods, such as \\ntarget organ delivery, may open a new door for the \\napplication of SIRT3 inhibitors. \\nConclusions \\nSIRT3, the major deacetylase in mitochondria, \\nhas been well-established to be involved in all aspects \\nof mitochondrial metabolism as well as the synthesis \\nand movement of mitochondria. Mitochondria play a \\nvery important role in cells, and their disorders \\ninduce a variety of diseases. The dysregulation of \\nSIRT3 has been confirmed in many mitochondria- \\nrelated diseases. \\nAn accumulation of current evidence has \\ngradually revealed the mysteries of the inherent \\nbiological \\nfunctions \\nof \\nSIRT3 \\nand \\nmedicinal \\napplications in human diseases. SIRT3 has been \\nattracting extensive attention from its original role as \\nthe longevity gene to being a potential “superstar” \\ntarget in many diseases. Several studies have \\ndemonstrated that the improved role of SIRT3 in \\nmany diseases is mainly due to its scavenging effect \\non ROS. Excessive accumulation of ROS is often an \\nimportant factor in the development of age-related \\ndiseases, heart disease, cancer and metabolic diseases. \\nSIRT3 activates its substrates such as MnSOD2, IDH2 \\nand PHD by deacetylation and then removes excess \\nROS. On the other hand, SIRT3 regulates TCA, \\nOXPHOS, fatty acid and amino acid metabolism to \\nmaintain mitochondria homeostasis in normal or \\nslightly damaged mitochondria to influence cell \\nfitness \\nand \\nsurvival. \\nHowever, \\nwhen \\nthe \\nmitochondria are too damaged to be repaired, SIRT3 \\ncan deacetylate and activate FOXO3a to induce \\nmitophagy, \\nthus \\neliminating \\nand \\ncirculating \\nmitochondria. Interestingly, regarding to its inherent \\ncomplexity, SIRT3 has been demonstrated to play the \\nJanus role in cancer, indicating that SIRT3 activators \\nor inhibitors would be utilized as anti-tumor agents in \\nspecific types of cancers, respectively. For instance, it \\ncannot be ignored that the application of SIRT3 \\ninhibitors in some OXPHOS-addiction cancers seems \\nvery promising, but in regarding to the protective \\neffects of SIRT3 on various human organs, inhibition \\nof SIRT3 might partially bring multiple organ \\ntoxicities. On the other hand, the excessive pursuit of \\nSIRT3 activation might also lead to unpredictable \\ncarcinogenesis under some circumstances. Thus, \\nconsidering either up-regulation or down-regulation \\nexpression of SIRT3 seems to be so limited for the \\ndiscovery of new small-molecule inhibitor or activator \\nin the treatment of different types of diseases. Maybe, \\nthe combination of SIRT3 activator/inhibitor and the \\nother drug in a new delivery system targeting specific \\nhuman organ would be an alternative potential \\ntherapeutic strategy. \\nHitherto, no specific SIRT3 activators or potent \\ninhibitors have been successfully discovered and thus \\nbeing utilized for potential therapeutics. But still, \\nseveral small-molecule compounds with therapeutic \\npotential have been reported. For example, the most \\nfamous SIRT3 activator, Honokiol, exhibits some \\ntherapeutic effects in heart disease, inflammation- \\nrelated diseases, cancer and metabolic diseases. \\nHowever, its beneficial effects are not entirely \\nattributed to the activation of SIRT3. The structural \\ncharacteristics of its polyphenols determine its \\noutstanding antioxidant capacity, which is also the \\nkey to its therapeutic activity. Similarly, although the \\nhighly selective SIRT3 inhibitor 3-TYP has good \\nproperties, it is only used as a probe with almost no \\ntherapeutic applications. \\nTherefore, how to develop an effective SIRT3 \\nactivator or inhibitor for therapeutic purposes \\nremains to be an enigma. In this regard, scientific drug \\ndesign strategy is particularly important. For the \\ndesign of SIRT3 activators, there is still a lack of \\neffective and scientific design methods at present. \\nBecause the mechanism of the interaction between \\nsmall molecule agonists and SIRT3 is still a black box, \\nthere is no basis for structure-based drug design. At \\npresent, allosteric agonists are one of the most \\nconvincing methods for the design of SIRT3 agonists. \\nRecently, artificial intelligence has been applied in the \\nfield of drug design, which has opened a new era of \\nrevolutionary drug design. However, much effort still \\nneeds to be made to elucidate the molecular \\nmechanism of SIRT3 allosteric activation. \\nAs a plan for SIRT3 inhibitor design, structure- \\nbased drug design is a mature and effective strategy, \\nincluding receptor- and ligand-based technology. \\nAmong \\nthem, \\nbasing \\nthis \\non \\nthe \\nbinding \\ncharacteristics of the substrate and SIRT3 complex is a \\nbetter choice for selective SIRT3 inhibitors. Co- \\nenzyme structure-based design is more likely to lose \\nselectivity, \\nresulting \\nin \\nserious \\nside \\neffects. \\nAdditionally, PROTAC technology is a new strategy \\nto design potent targeted inhibitors. Taken together, \\nSIRT3, from a mitochondrial metabolic regulator to a \\npromising therapeutic target, would shed new light \\nTheranostics 2020, Vol. 10, Issue 18 \\n \\n \\nhttp://www.thno.org \\n8338 \\non exploiting more candidate drugs for fighting \\nhuman diseases in the near future. \\nAbbreviations \\nSIRT3: Sirtuin 3; TCA: tricarboxylic acid; UPR: \\nunfolded protein response; OXPHOS: oxidative \\nphosphorylation; CR: Caloric Restriction; IDH2: \\nisocitrate dehydrogenase 2; FLSIRT3: full length \\nSIRT3; MPP: Matrix processing peptidase; 4-HNE: \\n4-Hydroxynonenal; PPARγ: Peroxisome proliferator- \\nactivated receptor γ; PGC-1α: PPARγ coactivator 1; \\nmiRNA: \\nMicroRNA; \\nISCU: \\niron-sulfur \\ncluster \\nassembly protein; LncRNAs: Long non-coding RNA; \\nAD: Alzheimer's disease; PD: Parkinson's disease; \\nHD: Huntington's disease; AML: Amyotrophic lateral \\nsclerosis; MnSOD2: manganous superoxide dismutase \\n2; ROS: reactive oxygen species; mPTP: mitochondrial \\npermeability \\ntransition \\npore; \\nNMNAT2: \\nNicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2; \\nHSP90: heat shock protein 90; HIF1α: hypoxia- \\ninducible factor-1a; PHD: prolyl hydroxylase; PDC: \\npyruvate dehydrogenase complex; Skp2: the F-box \\nprotein S-phase kinase associated protein 2; GSK-3β: \\nglycogen synthase kinase-3β; ECHS1: Enoyl-CoA \\nhydratase-1; GOT: Glutamate oxaloacetate trans-\\naminases; OGG1: 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase 1; \\nSHMT2: serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2; PYCR1: \\nPyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1; OPA1: Optic \\natrophy 1; OSCP: oligomycin-sensitivity conferring \\nprotein; CypD: cyclophilin D; LCAD: long-chain acyl \\nCoA dehydrogenase; NMNAT3: Nicotinamide mono-\\nnucleotide adenylyltransferase 3; STAT3: signal \\ntransducer and activator of transcription 3; AKI: acute \\nkidney injury; EndoMT: Endothelial-to-mesenchymal \\ntransition; NAFLD: nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; \\nHBV: Hepatitis B virus; cccDNA: covalently closed \\ncircular DNA; PDH: Pyruvate dehydrogenase; ZEB1: \\nZinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1; GOT2: \\nglutamate oxaloacetate transaminases 2; CLL: chronic \\nlymphocytic \\nleukemia; \\nHCC: \\nhepatocellular \\ncarcinoma; DLBCLs: diffuse large B cell lymphomas; \\nEMT: epithelial-mesenchymal transition; TNBC: triple \\nnegative breast cancer; ACC1: acetyl-coA carboxylase \\n1; GLYAT: Glycine N-acyltransferase; HMGCL: \\nhydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase; EPCs: endothelial \\nprogenitor cells. \\nAcknowledgements \\nWe are grateful to the assistance with the proper \\nusage of scientific English provided by Dr. L.J. \\nSparvero (University of Pittsburgh).

Their corresponding receptors have three subtypes, namely, β1, β2 and β3, which are members of the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) family. Activation of β1-adrenergic receptors causes various physiological reactions including cardiac contraction and renin secretion from juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney. Antagonists of β-adrenergic receptors, known as β-blockers, have been used effectively for over four decades and have beneficial effects in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. There are three generations of β-blockers according to their pharmacological properties. Firstgeneration β-blockers are non-selective, blocking both β1- and β2-receptors; second-generation β- blockers are more cardioselective in that they are more selective for β1-receptors; and thirdgeneration β-blockers are highly selective drugs for β1-receptors. The latter also display vasodilator actions by blocking α1-adrenoreceptors and activating β3-adrenergic receptors. In addition, thirdgeneration β-blockers exhibit angiogenic, antioxidant, anti-proliferative, anti-hypertrophic and antiapoptotic activities among other effects that are still under investigation.\", \"authors\": [\"Gabriel T do Vale\", \"Carla S Ceron\", \"Natália A Gonzaga\", \"Janaina A Simplicio\", \"Júlio C Padovan\"], \"year\": \"2019\", \"volume\": \"15\", \"issue\": \"1\", \"journal\": \"Current hypertension reviews\", \"citation\": \"2019;15(1)\", \"link\": \"https://doi.org/10.2174/1573402114666180918102735\", \"pdf_link\": \"No PDF link available\", \"full_content\": \"No full text link available\"}]\n",

The startling improvement in outcomes for babies born with congenital heart disease in general-and for those with tetralogy of Fallot in particular-is one of the success stories of modern medicine. Indeed, in many countries adults with tetralogy of Fallot outnumber children. Consequently, new issues have emerged, ranging from hitherto unpredicted medical complications to issues with training for caregivers and resource allocation for this population of survivors. Therefore, evolution of treatment, recognition of late complications, research on disease mechanisms and therapies-with feedback to changes in care of affected children born nowadays-are templates on which the timely discussion of organisation of care of those affected by congenital heart diseases from the fetus to the elderly can be based.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to prevent\\nand treat IHD. IHD is characterized by an imbalance in myocar-\\ndial blood supply and demand, which results in the death of car-\\ndiac cells. Heart attack, or myocardial infarction (MI), is the\\nmost common manifestation of IHD that results in cardiac cell\\ndeath (Hausenloy and Yellon 2016).\\nCurrently, some drug classes, such as b-receptor blockers, cal-\\ncium channel blockers, diuretics, nitrates and aspirin, are com-\\nmonly used in the treatment of IHD. Percutaneous coronary\\nintervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)\\ndecrease ischemia to a greater extent than medical therapy alone\\n(Boden et al. 2007). However, clinical outcomes have not\\nimproved commensurately. As a result, there is an urgent need\\nto develop complementary and alternative therapies for major\\nheart diseases (Pratt 2010). For thousands of years, traditional\\nChinese medicine, particularly herbal compounding, has been\\nthe most commonly used treatment for cardiovascular disease in\\nChina (Liu et al. 2011). As patients with IHD have different\\nclinical features or symptoms, different Chinese herbal formulas\\nare used for treatment.\\nDan-Shen Decoction is made up of three Chinese herbal med-\\nicines, namely Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Lamiaceae) (Danshen),\\nSantalum album L. (Santalaceae) (Tanxiang) and Amomum vil-\\nlosum Lour. (Zingiberaceae) (Sharen), all of which have been\\nshown to activate blood circulation and eliminate blood stasis\\n(Kong and Du 2019). The plant name has been checked with\\nMPNS (http://mpns.kew.org). Dan-Shen Decoction was first\\nmentioned in the book of Shi Fang Ge Kuo for the first time in\\n1801 A.D., with the comment, \\\"Dan-Shen Decoction has multiple\\neffects on heartache and epigastric pain, especially for women\\\".\\nA large body of evidence suggests that Dan-Shen Decoction\\nappears to have a wide range of pharmacological effects on the\\ncardiovascular system. Pretreatment with Dan-Shen Decoction\\nsignificantly lowers serum myocardial enzyme levels, reduces\\nmyocardial infarct area, lowers inflammatory factor expression\\nand protects cardiomyocytes from ischemia/reperfusion injury\\n(Hoo et al. 2021; Ren et al. 2021). The specific mechanism of\\nDan-Shen Decoction could be used to treat myocardial ischemia\\nby inhibiting the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3\\n(NLRP3) inflammatory vesicles, affecting the expression of apop-\\ntosis-related genes and regulating nitric oxide and endothelin\\nlevels (Wang and Li 2009; Luo et al. 2011; Yan et al. 2021).\\nCONTACT Guanhua Du\\ndugh@imm.ac.cn; Lianhua Fang\\nfanglh@imm.ac.cn\\nInstitute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking\\nUnion Medical College, 1 Xian Nong Tan Street, Beijing 100050, China\\n\\u0001 2022 The Author(s).

A\\nstudy had found that isorhamnetin intake was negatively cor-\\nrelated with the risk of coronary heart disease (Milanlouei\\net al. 2020), indicating the importance of isorhamnetin in the\\ntreatment\\nof\\ncardiovascular\\ndiseases.\\nMoreover,\\nPTGS2,\\nSCN5A, ADRB2, OPRM1 and CHRM1 were connected to\\nmore active components of Dan-Shen Decoction, which may\\nbe the key targets in the treatment of IHD.\\nThe PPI network showed the potential interaction between\\nthe 122 targets, and then we selected 15 hub genes from this net-\\nwork based on the degree value. Among them, AKT1 is a serine/\\nthreonine protein kinase that is involved in various biological\\nprocesses such as cell proliferation, metabolism, insulin signalling\\nand angiogenesis (Chen et al. 2017). Recent studies have found\\nthat AKT is involved in regulating the biological process of car-\\ndiomyocyte apoptosis in the IHD model (Han et al. 2018;\\nHuangfu et al. 2020). The JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway is\\nthought to be an important anti-IHD pathway because it can\\nregulate myocardial apoptosis and reduce mitochondrial oxida-\\ntive\\nstress\\ninjury\\n(Chen\\net\\nal.\\n2020;\\nLan\\net\\nal.\\n2019).\\nFurthermore, the JNK signalling pathway is a critical cellular\\ntransduction channel for cardiomyocyte death and plays an\\nimportant role in the development of cardiac ischemia–reperfu-\\nsion. Studies have found that salvianolic acid A may increase the\\nexpression of thioredoxin (Trx) and inhibit the activation of JNK\\nto\\nreduce\\napoptosis\\nand\\ninflammation\\nafter\\nMI\\n(Zhou\\net al. 2020).\\nRecent studies have found that salvianolic acid A can improve\\nendothelial-mesenchymal\\ntransition\\nin\\npulmonary\\nvascular\\nremodelling, inhibit inflammation and oxidative stress, and\\nattenuate vascular remodelling in a pulmonary hypertension\\nTable 4.

Among the active components, luteo-\\nlin and isorhamnetin were flavonoids with more hydrogen bond\\ndonors and acceptors, which made them conducive to the forma-\\ntion of hydrogen bonds with the targets and thus more stable\\nbinding. Therefore, Dan-Shen Decoction interacted with AKT1\\nand MAPK1 to regulate multiple targets and signalling pathways\\nand further affected the development of IHD.\\nTo verify the effects of Dan-Shen Decoction in vitro, this\\nstudy established a CoCl2-induced hypoxic H9c2 cell model. The\\nexpression of PI3K and its downstream proteins AKT1 and NF-\\njB, as well as MAPK1 and its downstream proteins JNK, STAT3\\nand c-JUN, was assessed (Chen 2011; Chen et al. 2013). The\\nresults showed that Dan-Shen Decoction had no significant effect\\non the expression of AKT, but it increased the phosphorylation\\nlevel of its downstream protein NF-jB and inhibited the expres-\\nsion of PI3K p110 and PI3K p85. In addition, Dan-Shen\\nDecoction inhibited the expression of STAT3, NF-jB and JNK,\\nand decreased the phosphorylation levels of c-JUN and MAPK1.\\nThe PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is a key pathway involved in cell\\nproliferation, differentiation, metabolism, cytoskeleton reorgan-\\nization and apoptosis (Chen et al. 2017). JNK is a member of the\\nMAPK family, which regulates several cellular functions, includ-\\ning proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and can be medi-\\nated by ROS to trigger inflammatory responses (Chen et al.\\n2018). The JAK2/STAT3 pathway, which is the MAPK down-\\nstream signalling pathway, protects the ischemic myocardium\\nand alleviates oxidative stress by promoting angiogenesis (Barry\\net al. 2009; Sui et al. 2019). As previously established, many of\\nthe potential targets of Dan-Shen Decoction against IHD are\\nenriched in oxidative stress-related biological processes. Similar\\nresults were also obtained in many previous biological experi-\\nments (Yan et al. 2012).\\nMost pharmacology experiments now focus on cellular and\\nanimal experiments, which have the advantages of ease of oper-\\nation and statistics but suffer from the limitation of species dif-\\nferences.\\nNetwork\\npharmacology,\\non\\nthe\\nother\\nhand,\\ncan\\nsupplement traditional pharmacology experiments. The signalling\\npathways confirmed by basic experiments can also be theoretic-\\nally justified at the network pharmacology level. The results of\\nthis paper provide a good theoretical basis for the study of anti-\\nIHD by providing specific signalling pathways and related target\\nproteins. Additionally, the mechanism of Dan-Shen Decoction\\nagainst IHD was further examined using molecular docking and\\npreliminary investigations.\\nHowever, this study still has some limitations. The key targets\\nand potential pathways obtained from the above analyses should\\nbe further explored through biological experiments. Moreover,\\nwe only docked AKT1 and MAPK1 with active components of\\nDan-Shen Decoction in the molecular docking. In a follow-up\\nstudy, we should not only conduct experiments in vivo and\\nin vitro to further elucidate the mechanism of Dan-Shen\\nDecoction but also analyze the mechanism with other key targets\\nbased on the results of further biological experiments.\\nConclusions\\nThis work demonstrates that several targets, including AKT1,\\nMAPK1, STAT3 and c-JUN, as well as several signalling path-\\nways, including cGMP-PKG, AGE-RAGE, HIF-1, PI3K/AKT,\\nJAK/STAT3 and JNK, are involved in the mechanism of Dan-\\nShen Decoction against IHD. Although further studies are neces-\\nsary to elucidate the precise mechanism, this study provides a\\ncomprehensive and systematic overview of possible targets and\\nsignalling pathways associated with the activities of Dan-Shen\\nDecoction against IHD, providing the theoretical foundation and\\nexperimental data for future pharmacological research.\\nConsent form\\nAll named authors have agreed to the publication of the work.\\nDisclosure statement\\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\\nFunding\\nThe research is financially supported by the National Natural\\nScience Foundation of China [No. 82141204, 82073853] and the\\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) Innovation Fund for\\nMedical Sciences [No. 2022-I2M-JB-010, 2021-I2M-1-005].\\nData availability statement\\nThe datasets we generated during the analysis are not publicly avail-\\nable because the analysis process is the core of the results and can-\\nnot be made public.

However, systematic research on the exact mechanism of\\naction of Dan-Shen Decoction is still lacking. The anti-IHD effect of Dan-Shen Decoction was examined in\\nthis study using a systematic pharmacological method.\\nObjective: This study validates the efficacy and explores the potential mechanisms of Dan-Shen\\nDecoction in treating IHD by integrating network pharmacology analyses and experimental verification.\\nMaterials and methods: The active components, critical targets and potential mechanisms of Dan-Shen\\nDecoction against IHD were predicted by network pharmacology and molecule docking. H9c2 cells were\\npretreated with various 1 mg/mL Dan-Shen Decoction for 2 h before induction with 1000 mmol/L CoCl2 for\\n24 h. The cell viability was detected by CCK8, and protein expression was detected by western blots.\\nResults: The network pharmacology approach successfully identified 69 active components in Dan-Shen\\nDecoction, and 122 potential targets involved in the treatment of IHD. The in vitro experiments indicate\\nthat the anti-IHD effect of Dan-Shen Decoction may be closely associated with targets such as AKT1 and\\nMAPK1, as well as biological processes such as cell proliferation, inflammatory response, and metabolism.\\nConclusions: This study not only provides new insights into the mechanism of Dan-Shen Decoction\\nagainst IHD, but also provides important information and new research ideas for the discovery of anti-\\nIHD compounds from traditional Chinese medicine.\\nARTICLE HISTORY\\nReceived 17 August 2022\\nRevised 7 October 2022\\nAccepted 20 November 2022\\nKEYWORDS\\nMolecular docking; H9c2\\ncells; mechanism\\nIntroduction\\nCardiovascular diseases are major life-threatening diseases, and\\nthe death rate from ischemic heart disease (IHD) is increasing.\\nIn 2019, the number of deaths caused by IHD worldwide\\nreached 9.14 million, which is expected to rise in the future\\n(Roth et al. 2020). Therefore, there is an urgent need to prevent\\nand treat IHD. IHD is characterized by an imbalance in myocar-\\ndial blood supply and demand, which results in the death of car-\\ndiac cells. Heart attack, or myocardial infarction (MI), is the\\nmost common manifestation of IHD that results in cardiac cell\\ndeath (Hausenloy and Yellon 2016).\\nCurrently, some drug classes, such as b-receptor blockers, cal-\\ncium channel blockers, diuretics, nitrates and aspirin, are com-\\nmonly used in the treatment of IHD. Percutaneous coronary\\nintervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)\\ndecrease ischemia to a greater extent than medical therapy alone\\n(Boden et al. 2007). However, clinical outcomes have not\\nimproved commensurately. As a result, there is an urgent need\\nto develop complementary and alternative therapies for major\\nheart diseases (Pratt 2010). For thousands of years, traditional\\nChinese medicine, particularly herbal compounding, has been\\nthe most commonly used treatment for cardiovascular disease in\\nChina (Liu et al. 2011). As patients with IHD have different\\nclinical features or symptoms, different Chinese herbal formulas\\nare used for treatment.\\nDan-Shen Decoction is made up of three Chinese herbal med-\\nicines, namely Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Lamiaceae) (Danshen),\\nSantalum album L. (Santalaceae) (Tanxiang) and Amomum vil-\\nlosum Lour. (Zingiberaceae) (Sharen), all of which have been\\nshown to activate blood circulation and eliminate blood stasis\\n(Kong and Du 2019). The plant name has been checked with\\nMPNS (http://mpns.kew.org). Dan-Shen Decoction was first\\nmentioned in the book of Shi Fang Ge Kuo for the first time in\\n1801 A.D., with the comment, \\\"Dan-Shen Decoction has multiple\\neffects on heartache and epigastric pain, especially for women\\\".\\nA large body of evidence suggests that Dan-Shen Decoction\\nappears to have a wide range of pharmacological effects on the\\ncardiovascular system. Pretreatment with Dan-Shen Decoction\\nsignificantly lowers serum myocardial enzyme levels, reduces\\nmyocardial infarct area, lowers inflammatory factor expression\\nand protects cardiomyocytes from ischemia/reperfusion injury\\n(Hoo et al. 2021; Ren et al. 2021). The specific mechanism of\\nDan-Shen Decoction could be used to treat myocardial ischemia\\nby inhibiting the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3\\n(NLRP3) inflammatory vesicles, affecting the expression of apop-\\ntosis-related genes and regulating nitric oxide and endothelin\\nlevels (Wang and Li 2009; Luo et al. 2011; Yan et al. 2021).\\nCONTACT Guanhua Du\\ndugh@imm.ac.cn; Lianhua Fang\\nfanglh@imm.ac.cn\\nInstitute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking\\nUnion Medical College, 1 Xian Nong Tan Street, Beijing 100050, China\\n\\u0001 2022 The Author(s).

A\\nstudy had found that isorhamnetin intake was negatively cor-\\nrelated with the risk of coronary heart disease (Milanlouei\\net al. 2020), indicating the importance of isorhamnetin in the\\ntreatment\\nof\\ncardiovascular\\ndiseases.\\nMoreover,\\nPTGS2,\\nSCN5A, ADRB2, OPRM1 and CHRM1 were connected to\\nmore active components of Dan-Shen Decoction, which may\\nbe the key targets in the treatment of IHD.\\nThe PPI network showed the potential interaction between\\nthe 122 targets, and then we selected 15 hub genes from this net-\\nwork based on the degree value. Among them, AKT1 is a serine/\\nthreonine protein kinase that is involved in various biological\\nprocesses such as cell proliferation, metabolism, insulin signalling\\nand angiogenesis (Chen et al. 2017). Recent studies have found\\nthat AKT is involved in regulating the biological process of car-\\ndiomyocyte apoptosis in the IHD model (Han et al. 2018;\\nHuangfu et al. 2020). The JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway is\\nthought to be an important anti-IHD pathway because it can\\nregulate myocardial apoptosis and reduce mitochondrial oxida-\\ntive\\nstress\\ninjury\\n(Chen\\net\\nal.\\n2020;\\nLan\\net\\nal.\\n2019).\\nFurthermore, the JNK signalling pathway is a critical cellular\\ntransduction channel for cardiomyocyte death and plays an\\nimportant role in the development of cardiac ischemia–reperfu-\\nsion. Studies have found that salvianolic acid A may increase the\\nexpression of thioredoxin (Trx) and inhibit the activation of JNK\\nto\\nreduce\\napoptosis\\nand\\ninflammation\\nafter\\nMI\\n(Zhou\\net al. 2020).\\nRecent studies have found that salvianolic acid A can improve\\nendothelial-mesenchymal\\ntransition\\nin\\npulmonary\\nvascular\\nremodelling, inhibit inflammation and oxidative stress, and\\nattenuate vascular remodelling in a pulmonary hypertension\\nTable 4.

The results are shown as the mean ± SEM. \\u0005\\u0005p < 0.01 compared with the control group, #p < 0.05, compared\\nwith the CoCl2-treated group (n ¼ 3).\\nPHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGY\\n77\\neffects on two key targets. Among the active components, luteo-\\nlin and isorhamnetin were flavonoids with more hydrogen bond\\ndonors and acceptors, which made them conducive to the forma-\\ntion of hydrogen bonds with the targets and thus more stable\\nbinding. Therefore, Dan-Shen Decoction interacted with AKT1\\nand MAPK1 to regulate multiple targets and signalling pathways\\nand further affected the development of IHD.\\nTo verify the effects of Dan-Shen Decoction in vitro, this\\nstudy established a CoCl2-induced hypoxic H9c2 cell model. The\\nexpression of PI3K and its downstream proteins AKT1 and NF-\\njB, as well as MAPK1 and its downstream proteins JNK, STAT3\\nand c-JUN, was assessed (Chen 2011; Chen et al. 2013). The\\nresults showed that Dan-Shen Decoction had no significant effect\\non the expression of AKT, but it increased the phosphorylation\\nlevel of its downstream protein NF-jB and inhibited the expres-\\nsion of PI3K p110 and PI3K p85. In addition, Dan-Shen\\nDecoction inhibited the expression of STAT3, NF-jB and JNK,\\nand decreased the phosphorylation levels of c-JUN and MAPK1.\\nThe PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is a key pathway involved in cell\\nproliferation, differentiation, metabolism, cytoskeleton reorgan-\\nization and apoptosis (Chen et al. 2017). JNK is a member of the\\nMAPK family, which regulates several cellular functions, includ-\\ning proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and can be medi-\\nated by ROS to trigger inflammatory responses (Chen et al.\\n2018). The JAK2/STAT3 pathway, which is the MAPK down-\\nstream signalling pathway, protects the ischemic myocardium\\nand alleviates oxidative stress by promoting angiogenesis (Barry\\net al. 2009; Sui et al. 2019). As previously established, many of\\nthe potential targets of Dan-Shen Decoction against IHD are\\nenriched in oxidative stress-related biological processes. Similar\\nresults were also obtained in many previous biological experi-\\nments (Yan et al. 2012).\\nMost pharmacology experiments now focus on cellular and\\nanimal experiments, which have the advantages of ease of oper-\\nation and statistics but suffer from the limitation of species dif-\\nferences.\\nNetwork\\npharmacology,\\non\\nthe\\nother\\nhand,\\ncan\\nsupplement traditional pharmacology experiments. The signalling\\npathways confirmed by basic experiments can also be theoretic-\\nally justified at the network pharmacology level. The results of\\nthis paper provide a good theoretical basis for the study of anti-\\nIHD by providing specific signalling pathways and related target\\nproteins. Additionally, the mechanism of Dan-Shen Decoction\\nagainst IHD was further examined using molecular docking and\\npreliminary investigations.\\nHowever, this study still has some limitations. The key targets\\nand potential pathways obtained from the above analyses should\\nbe further explored through biological experiments. Moreover,\\nwe only docked AKT1 and MAPK1 with active components of\\nDan-Shen Decoction in the molecular docking. In a follow-up\\nstudy, we should not only conduct experiments in vivo and\\nin vitro to further elucidate the mechanism of Dan-Shen\\nDecoction but also analyze the mechanism with other key targets\\nbased on the results of further biological experiments.\\nConclusions\\nThis work demonstrates that several targets, including AKT1,\\nMAPK1, STAT3 and c-JUN, as well as several signalling path-\\nways, including cGMP-PKG, AGE-RAGE, HIF-1, PI3K/AKT,\\nJAK/STAT3 and JNK, are involved in the mechanism of Dan-\\nShen Decoction against IHD. Although further studies are neces-\\nsary to elucidate the precise mechanism, this study provides a\\ncomprehensive and systematic overview of possible targets and\\nsignalling pathways associated with the activities of Dan-Shen\\nDecoction against IHD, providing the theoretical foundation and\\nexperimental data for future pharmacological research.\\nConsent form\\nAll named authors have agreed to the publication of the work.\\nDisclosure statement\\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).\\nFunding\\nThe research is financially supported by the National Natural\\nScience Foundation of China [No. 82141204, 82073853] and the\\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) Innovation Fund for\\nMedical Sciences [No. 2022-I2M-JB-010, 2021-I2M-1-005].\\nData availability statement\\nThe datasets we generated during the analysis are not publicly avail-\\nable because the analysis process is the core of the results and can-\\nnot be made public.

Activation of β1-adrenergic receptors causes various physiological reactions including cardiac contraction and renin secretion from juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney. Antagonists of β-adrenergic receptors, known as β-blockers, have been used effectively for over four decades and have beneficial effects in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. There are three generations of β-blockers according to their pharmacological properties. Firstgeneration β-blockers are non-selective, blocking both β1- and β2-receptors; second-generation β- blockers are more cardioselective in that they are more selective for β1-receptors; and thirdgeneration β-blockers are highly selective drugs for β1-receptors. The latter also display vasodilator actions by blocking α1-adrenoreceptors and activating β3-adrenergic receptors.
