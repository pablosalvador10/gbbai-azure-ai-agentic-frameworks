      "\n",
      "### Abstract\n",
      "This study investigates the effects of a new drug, CardioX, on heart disease. Conducted over a period of 12 months, the research involved 500 patients diagnosed with varying stages of heart disease. Participants were randomly assigned to either the CardioX group or a placebo group. Efficacy was assessed through changes in key cardiovascular biomarkers and patient symptoms, while safety was monitored through adverse event reporting. Results indicated that CardioX significantly improved cardiac function and patient-reported symptoms with a manageable safety profile, suggesting its potential as a new treatment option for heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Introduction\n",
      "Heart disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CardioX, a novel pharmaceutical agent designed to enhance cardiac function and reduce symptoms associated with heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Methodology\n",
      "#### Study Design\n",
      "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Participants\n",
      "500 patients aged 40-75 with clinically diagnosed heart disease were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or other severe systemic illnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Randomization and Blinding\n",
      "Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CardioX (100 mg daily) or a matching placebo. Randomization was computer-generated, and both participants and researchers were blinded to the group assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Interventions\n",
      "CardioX or placebo was administered orally once daily for 12 months. Adherence to treatment was assessed through pill counts, patient diaries, and electronic monitoring systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Outcome Measures\n",
      "Primary outcomes included changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and levels of biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). The rationale for selecting these markers centers on their established role in diagnosing and prognosticating heart disease. LVEF is a crucial measure of cardiac function, while BNP levels correlate with ventricular strain and heart failure severity. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the frequency of adverse events.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Statistical Analysis\n",
      "A sample size of 500 participants was calculated to provide an 80% power to detect a 10% improvement in LVEF with a significance level of 0.05. Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. Continuous variables were compared using paired t-tests, and categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Results\n",
      "500 participants were randomized, with 250 in each group. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Efficacy\n",
      "- Mean LVEF improved by 12% in the CardioX group compared to 4% in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- BNP levels decreased by 30% in the CardioX group, significantly more than the 10% reduction observed in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- The KCCQ scores improved by an average of 15 points in the CardioX group, compared to 5 points in the placebo group (p<0.05).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Safety\n",
      "- Adverse events were reported in 30% of the CardioX group, compared to 25% in the placebo group.\n",
      "- Most common adverse events in the CardioX group included mild gastrointestinal symptoms and transient dizziness.\n",
      "- Serious adverse events were comparable between groups, with no significant differences detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Subgroup Analyses\n",
      "Subgroup analyses revealed that the efficacy of CardioX was consistent across various stages of heart disease, age, and gender differences, highlighting its potential broad applicability.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Discussion\n",
      "CardioX significantly improved key measures of cardiac function and patient quality of life compared to placebo, supporting its efficacy in the treatment of heart disease.

      "### Introduction\n",
      "Heart disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. According to the World Health Organization, roughly 17.9 million people die from cardiovascular diseases each year, accounting for 31% of global deaths. Despite advances in treatments, current therapies often fall short in reversing the progression of heart disease or significantly improving quality of life for patients. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CardioX, a novel pharmaceutical agent designed to enhance cardiac function and reduce symptoms associated with heart disease. Our hypothesis is that CardioX will significantly improve cardiac function and patient-reported outcomes compared to placebo in patients with heart disease.\n",

      "### Discussion\n",
      "CardioX significantly improved LVEF, reduced BNP levels, and enhanced patient-reported outcomes, supporting its efficacy in treating heart disease. The strengths of this study include its robust randomized controlled design and comprehensive outcome assessments. The observed efficacy and safety profile of CardioX compares favorably with current heart disease treatments, indicating its potential as an advanced therapeutic option. Potential mechanisms of action for CardioX include enhanced myocardial energy metabolism and reduced ventricular strain. Limitations of this study include the relatively short follow-up period and the need for larger, multicenter trials to confirm long-term efficacy and safety.\n",

      "Medical Editor Response History: [{'content': \"## Title: Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of CardioX in the Treatment of Heart Disease\\n\\n### Abstract\\nThis study investigates the effects of a new drug, CardioX, on heart disease. Conducted over a period of 12 months, the research involved 500 patients diagnosed with varying stages of heart disease. Participants were randomly assigned to either the CardioX group or a placebo group. Efficacy was assessed through changes in key cardiovascular biomarkers and patient symptoms, while safety was monitored through adverse event reporting. Results indicated that CardioX significantly improved cardiac function and patient-reported symptoms with a manageable safety profile, suggesting its potential as a new treatment option for heart disease.\\n\\n### Introduction\\nHeart disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CardioX, a novel pharmaceutical agent designed to enhance cardiac function and reduce symptoms associated with heart disease.\\n\\n### Methodology\\n#### Study Design\\nThis randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.\\n\\n#### Participants\\n500 patients aged 40-75 with clinically diagnosed heart disease were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or other severe systemic illnesses.\\n\\n#### Randomization and Blinding\\nParticipants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CardioX (100 mg daily) or a matching placebo. Randomization was computer-generated, and both participants and researchers were blinded to the group assignments.\\n\\n#### Interventions\\nCardioX or placebo was administered orally once daily for 12 months. Adherence to treatment was assessed through pill counts, patient diaries, and electronic monitoring systems.\\n\\n#### Outcome Measures\\nPrimary outcomes included changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and levels of biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). The rationale for selecting these markers centers on their established role in diagnosing and prognosticating heart disease. LVEF is a crucial measure of cardiac function, while BNP levels correlate with ventricular strain and heart failure severity. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the frequency of adverse events.\\n\\n#### Statistical Analysis\\nA sample size of 500 participants was calculated to provide an 80% power to detect a 10% improvement in LVEF with a significance level of 0.05. Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. Continuous variables were compared using paired t-tests, and categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\\n\\n### Results\\n500 participants were randomized, with 250 in each group. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups.\\n\\n#### Efficacy\\n- Mean LVEF improved by 12% in the CardioX group compared to 4% in the placebo group (p<0.001).\\n- BNP levels decreased by 30% in the CardioX group, significantly more than the 10% reduction observed in the placebo group (p<0.001).\\n- The KCCQ scores improved by an average of 15 points in the CardioX group, compared to 5 points in the placebo group (p<0.05).\\n\\n#### Safety\\n- Adverse events were reported in 30% of the CardioX group, compared to 25% in the placebo group.\\n- Most common adverse events in the CardioX group included mild gastrointestinal symptoms and transient dizziness.\\n- Serious adverse events were comparable between groups, with no significant differences detected.\\n\\n#### Subgroup Analyses\\nSubgroup analyses revealed that the efficacy of CardioX was consistent across various stages of heart disease, age, and gender differences, highlighting its potential broad applicability.\\n\\n### Discussion\\nCardioX significantly improved key measures of cardiac function and patient quality of life compared to placebo, supporting its efficacy in the treatment of heart disease. The study's strengths include a robust randomized controlled design and comprehensive outcome assessments. The choice of biomarkers such as LVEF and BNP is substantiated by their relevance in clinical heart disease management. \\n\\nLimitations include the relatively short follow-up period and the need for larger studies to confirm long-term efficacy and safety. The discussion section compares these results with existing literature on similar treatments, showing that CardioX's efficacy and safety profile compares favorably with current standards of care.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThis study demonstrates that CardioX is a promising new treatment for heart disease, offering significant improvements in cardiac function and patient quality of life. Future studies should focus on long-term outcomes, multicenter trials, and comparisons with existing therapies to further establish CardioX‚Äôs role in the management of heart disease.\\n\\n### Acknowledgements\\nThe authors thank the participants, clinical staff, and funding bodies who made this research possible.\\n\\n### References\\n[To be filled in with relevant literature and sources referenced in the study]\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Compliance With Ethical Standards\\n- **Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest:** None reported.\\n- **Research involving human participants and/or animals:** This research involved human participants and was conducted following ethical guidelines.\\n- **Informed consent:** Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.

Statistical significance was confirmed at p<0.05.\\n\\n### Introduction\\nHeart disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. According to the World Health Organization, roughly 17.9 million people die from cardiovascular diseases each year, accounting for 31% of global deaths. Despite advances in treatments, current therapies often fall short in reversing the progression of heart disease or significantly improving quality of life for patients. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CardioX, a novel pharmaceutical agent designed to enhance cardiac function and reduce symptoms associated with heart disease. Our hypothesis is that CardioX will significantly improve cardiac function and patient-reported outcomes compared to placebo in patients with heart disease.\\n\\n### Methodology\\n#### Study Design\\nThis is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT01234567).\\n\\n#### Participants\\n500 patients aged 40-75 with clinically diagnosed heart disease, classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II to IV, were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or other severe systemic illnesses determined through pre-screening tests.\\n\\n#### Randomization and Blinding\\nParticipants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CardioX (100 mg daily) or a matching placebo using computer-generated sequences. Both participants and researchers were blinded to the group assignments, and placebo capsules were identical in appearance to the treatment drug to prevent unblinding.\\n\\n#### Interventions\\nCardioX or placebo was administered orally once daily for 12 months. Treatment adherence was assessed through pill counts, patient diaries, and electronic monitoring systems, audited periodically.\\n\\n#### Outcome Measures\\nPrimary outcomes included changes in LVEF and BNP levels. Secondary outcomes were patient-reported outcomes measured by the KCCQ and the frequency of adverse events. Pre-specified thresholds for significance were a 5% or greater improvement in LVEF and a 20% or greater reduction in BNP levels.\\n\\n#### Statistical Analysis\\nA sample size of 500 participants was calculated to provide an 80% power to detect a 10% improvement in LVEF with a significance level of 0.05. Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. Continuous variables were compared using paired t-tests, and categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. Adjustments for potential confounders were made by including baseline characteristics in multivariate regression models. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant, with multiple comparisons corrected using the Bonferroni method.\\n\\n### Results\\n500 participants were randomized, with 250 in each group. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups.\\n\\n#### Efficacy\\n- Mean LVEF improved by 12% (95% CI, 10-14%) in the CardioX group compared to 4% (95% CI, 2-6%) in the placebo group (p<0.001, adjusted).\\n- BNP levels decreased by 30% (95% CI, 25-35%) in the CardioX group, significantly more than the 10% (95% CI, 5-15%) reduction observed in the placebo group (p<0.001, adjusted).\\n- The KCCQ scores improved by an average of 15 points (95% CI, 12-18 points) in the CardioX group, compared to 5 points (95% CI, 3-7 points) in the placebo group (p<0.05).\\n\\n#### Safety\\n- Adverse events were reported in 30% of the CardioX group, compared to 25% in the placebo group. Common adverse events included mild gastrointestinal symptoms and transient dizziness.\\n- Serious adverse events were comparable between groups (CardioX: 3%, Placebo: 4%).\\n- Adverse events were categorized using a pre-specified severity grading system, with a clinical adjudication committee reviewing all serious events.\\n\\n#### Subgroup Analyses\\nSubgroup analyses revealed consistent efficacy of CardioX across varying stages of heart disease, age, and gender. Subgroups were defined based on baseline disease severity, age brackets, and gender. Statistical methods included interaction terms in regression models to evaluate differential effects across subgroups.\\n\\n### Discussion\\nCardioX significantly improved LVEF, reduced BNP levels, and enhanced patient-reported outcomes, supporting its efficacy in treating heart disease. The strengths of this study include its robust randomized controlled design and comprehensive outcome assessments. The observed efficacy and safety profile of CardioX compares favorably with current heart disease treatments, indicating its potential as an advanced therapeutic option. Potential mechanisms of action for CardioX include enhanced myocardial energy metabolism and reduced ventricular strain. Limitations of this study include the relatively short follow-up period and the need for larger, multicenter trials to confirm long-term efficacy and safety.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThis study demonstrates that CardioX is a promising treatment for heart disease, offering significant improvements in cardiac function and patient quality of life. Future research should focus on long-term outcomes, multicenter trials, and comparisons with existing therapies to further establish CardioX‚Äôs role in the management of heart disease.\\n\\n### Acknowledgements\\nThe authors thank the participants, clinical staff, and funding bodies who made this research possible.\\n\\n### References\\n[To be filled in with relevant literature and sources referenced in the study]\\n\\n### Compliance With Ethical Standards\\n- **Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest:** None reported.\\n- **Research involving human participants and/or animals:** This research involved human participants and was conducted following ethical guidelines.\\n- **Informed consent:** Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.

      "### Abstract\n",
      "This study investigates the effects of a new drug, CardioX, on heart disease. Conducted over a period of 12 months, the research involved 500 patients diagnosed with varying stages of heart disease. Participants were randomly assigned to either the CardioX group or a placebo group. Efficacy was assessed through changes in key cardiovascular biomarkers and patient symptoms, while safety was monitored through adverse event reporting. Results indicated that CardioX significantly improved cardiac function and patient-reported symptoms with a manageable safety profile, suggesting its potential as a new treatment option for heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Introduction\n",
      "Heart disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CardioX, a novel pharmaceutical agent designed to enhance cardiac function and reduce symptoms associated with heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Methodology\n",
      "#### Study Design\n",
      "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Participants\n",
      "500 patients aged 40-75 with clinically diagnosed heart disease were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or other severe systemic illnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Randomization and Blinding\n",
      "Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CardioX (100 mg daily) or a matching placebo. Randomization was computer-generated, and both participants and researchers were blinded to the group assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Interventions\n",
      "CardioX or placebo was administered orally once daily for 12 months. Adherence to treatment was assessed through pill counts, patient diaries, and electronic monitoring systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Outcome Measures\n",
      "Primary outcomes included changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and levels of biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). The rationale for selecting these markers centers on their established role in diagnosing and prognosticating heart disease. LVEF is a crucial measure of cardiac function, while BNP levels correlate with ventricular strain and heart failure severity. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the frequency of adverse events.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Statistical Analysis\n",
      "A sample size of 500 participants was calculated to provide an 80% power to detect a 10% improvement in LVEF with a significance level of 0.05. Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. Continuous variables were compared using paired t-tests, and categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Results\n",
      "500 participants were randomized, with 250 in each group. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Efficacy\n",
      "- Mean LVEF improved by 12% in the CardioX group compared to 4% in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- BNP levels decreased by 30% in the CardioX group, significantly more than the 10% reduction observed in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- The KCCQ scores improved by an average of 15 points in the CardioX group, compared to 5 points in the placebo group (p<0.05).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Safety\n",
      "- Adverse events were reported in 30% of the CardioX group, compared to 25% in the placebo group.\n",
      "- Most common adverse events in the CardioX group included mild gastrointestinal symptoms and transient dizziness.\n",
      "- Serious adverse events were comparable between groups, with no significant differences detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Subgroup Analyses\n",
      "Subgroup analyses revealed that the efficacy of CardioX was consistent across various stages of heart disease, age, and gender differences, highlighting its potential broad applicability.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Discussion\n",
      "CardioX significantly improved key measures of cardiac function and patient quality of life compared to placebo, supporting its efficacy in the treatment of heart disease. The study's strengths include a robust randomized controlled design and comprehensive outcome assessments. The choice of biomarkers such as LVEF and BNP is substantiated by their relevance in clinical heart disease management. \n",
      "\n",
      "Limitations include the relatively short follow-up period and the need for larger studies to confirm long-term efficacy and safety. The discussion section compares these results with existing literature on similar treatments, showing that CardioX's efficacy and safety profile compares favorably with current standards of care.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "This study demonstrates that CardioX is a promising new treatment for heart disease, offering significant improvements in cardiac function and patient quality of life. Future studies should focus on long-term outcomes, multicenter trials, and comparisons with existing therapies to further establish CardioX‚Äôs role in the management of heart disease.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Abstract\n",
      "This study investigates the effects of a new drug, CardioX, on heart disease. Conducted over a period of 12 months, the research involved 500 patients diagnosed with varying stages of heart disease. Participants were randomly assigned to either the CardioX group or a placebo group. Efficacy was assessed through changes in key cardiovascular biomarkers and patient symptoms, while safety was monitored through adverse event reporting. Results indicated that CardioX significantly improved cardiac function and patient-reported symptoms with a manageable safety profile, suggesting its potential as a new treatment option for heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Introduction\n",
      "Heart disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CardioX, a novel pharmaceutical agent designed to enhance cardiac function and reduce symptoms associated with heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Methodology\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Participants\n",
      "500 patients aged 40-75 with clinically diagnosed heart disease were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or other severe systemic illnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Randomization and Blinding\n",
      "Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CardioX (100 mg daily) or a matching placebo. Randomization was computer-generated, and both participants and researchers were blinded to the group assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Interventions\n",
      "CardioX or placebo was administered orally once daily for 12 months. Adherence to treatment was assessed through pill counts and patient diaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Outcome Measures\n",
      "Primary outcomes included changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and levels of biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the frequency of adverse events.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Statistical Analysis\n",
      "Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. Continuous variables were compared using paired t-tests, and categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Results\n",
      "500 participants were randomized, with 250 in each group. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups.\n",
      "\n",

      "- BNP levels decreased by 30% in the CardioX group, significantly more than the 10% reduction observed in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- The KCCQ scores improved by an average of 15 points in the CardioX group, compared to 5 points in the placebo group (p<0.05).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Safety\n",
      "- Adverse events were reported in 30% of the CardioX group, compared to 25% in the placebo group.\n",
      "- Most common adverse events in the CardioX group included mild gastrointestinal symptoms and transient dizziness.\n",
      "- Serious adverse events were comparable between groups, with no significant differences detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Discussion\n",
      "CardioX significantly improved key measures of cardiac function and patient quality of life compared to placebo, supporting its efficacy in the treatment of heart disease.

      "### Abstract\n",
      "\n",
      "This study investigates the effects of a new drug, CardioX, on heart disease. Conducted over a period of 12 months, the research involved 500 patients diagnosed with varying stages of heart disease. Participants were randomly assigned to either the CardioX group or a placebo group. Efficacy was assessed through changes in key cardiovascular biomarkers and patient symptoms, while safety was monitored through adverse event reporting. Results indicated that CardioX significantly improved cardiac function and patient-reported symptoms with a manageable safety profile, suggesting its potential as a new treatment option for heart disease.\n",

      "### Methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Study Design\n",
      "\n",
      "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), specifically the [Name of IRB Committee], under IRB approval number [IRB Number]. The trial was conducted in adherence to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Participants\n",
      "\n",
      "500 patients aged 40-75 with clinically diagnosed heart disease were enrolled. The age range of 40-75 was selected to focus on the population most commonly affected by heart disease and to ensure the safety and efficacy of CardioX in this demographic. Pregnant women and individuals with renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or other severe systemic illnesses were excluded due to the potential for increased risk or confounding variables. Efforts to ensure inclusion of diverse demographic groups (e.g., gender, race) within the chosen age range were implemented to generalize findings appropriately.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Randomization and Blinding\n",
      "\n",
      "Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CardioX (100 mg daily) or a matching placebo. Randomization was computer-generated, and both participants and researchers were blinded to the group assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Interventions\n",
      "\n",
      "CardioX or placebo was administered orally once daily for 12 months. Adherence to treatment was assessed through pill counts and patient diaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Outcome Measures\n",
      "\n",
      "Primary outcomes included changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and levels of biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the frequency of adverse events.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Statistical Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. Continuous variables were compared using paired t-tests, and categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. Missing data were addressed using multiple imputation methods to preserve the integrity of the dataset. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the findings under various assumptions. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Results\n",
      "\n",
      "500 participants were successfully randomized, with 250 in each group. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Efficacy\n",
      "\n",
      "- Mean LVEF improved by 12% in the CardioX group compared to 4% in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- BNP levels decreased by 30% in the CardioX group, significantly more than the 10% reduction observed in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- The KCCQ scores improved by an average of 15 points in the CardioX group, compared to 5 points in the placebo group (p<0.05).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Safety\n",
      "\n",
      "Adverse events were reported in 30% of the CardioX group, compared to 25% in the placebo group. Adverse events were categorized by severity as mild, moderate, or severe. Mild events included symptoms like minor gastrointestinal disturbances and dizziness. Serious adverse events, defined as any event resulting in hospitalization, being life-threatening, or requiring discontinuation of the study drug, were comparable between groups, with no significant differences detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "CardioX significantly improved key measures of cardiac function and patient quality of life compared to placebo, supporting its efficacy in the treatment of heart disease. The manageable safety profile observed aligns with expectations for a novel therapeutic agent. While CardioX demonstrated significant improvements in cardiac function and quality of life, the incidence of adverse events was slightly higher in the treatment group (30% vs. 25%). A comprehensive risk-benefit analysis suggests that, given the benefits observed, the adverse events are manageable. However, ongoing monitoring is essential to ensure patient safety. The study's strengths include a robust randomized controlled design and comprehensive outcome assessments. Limitations include the relatively short follow-up period and the need for larger studies to confirm long-term efficacy and safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "This study demonstrates that CardioX is a promising new treatment for heart disease, offering significant improvements in cardiac function and patient quality of life. Future studies should focus on long-term outcomes and comparisons with existing therapies to further establish CardioX‚Äôs role in the management of heart disease.\n",

      "500 patients aged 40-75 with clinically diagnosed heart disease were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or other severe systemic illnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Randomization and Blinding\n",
      "Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CardioX (100 mg daily) or a matching placebo. Randomization was computer-generated, and both participants and researchers were blinded to the group assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Interventions\n",
      "CardioX or placebo was administered orally once daily for 12 months. Adherence to treatment was assessed through pill counts and patient diaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Outcome Measures\n",
      "Primary outcomes included changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and levels of biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the frequency of adverse events.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Statistical Analysis\n",
      "Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. Continuous variables were compared using paired t-tests, and categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Results\n",
      "500 participants were randomized, with 250 in each group. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Efficacy\n",
      "- Mean LVEF improved by 12% in the CardioX group compared to 4% in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- BNP levels decreased by 30% in the CardioX group, significantly more than the 10% reduction observed in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- The KCCQ scores improved by an average of 15 points in the CardioX group, compared to 5 points in the placebo group (p<0.05).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Safety\n",
      "- Adverse events were reported in 30% of the CardioX group, compared to 25% in the placebo group.\n",
      "- Most common adverse events in the CardioX group included mild gastrointestinal symptoms and transient dizziness.\n",
      "- Serious adverse events were comparable between groups, with no significant differences detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Discussion\n",
      "CardioX significantly improved key measures of cardiac function and patient quality of life compared to placebo, supporting its efficacy in the treatment of heart disease. The manageable safety profile observed aligns with expectations for a novel therapeutic agent. The study's strengths include a robust randomized controlled design and comprehensive outcome assessments. \n",
      "\n",
      "Limitations include the relatively short follow-up period and the need for larger studies to confirm long-term efficacy and safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "This study demonstrates that CardioX is a promising new treatment for heart disease, offering significant improvements in cardiac function and patient quality of life. Future studies should focus on long-term outcomes and comparisons with existing therapies to further establish CardioX‚Äôs role in the management of heart disease.\n",

      "### Ethical Considerations\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Ethical Approval\n",
      "**Current Text**: \"This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggested Revision**: \"This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), specifically the [Name of IRB Committee], under IRB approval number [IRB Number]. The trial was conducted in adherence to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Informed Consent Process\n",
      "**Current Text**: \"Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggested Revision**: \"Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study through a comprehensive consent process. Participants received written and verbal explanations regarding the study‚Äôs purpose, procedures, potential risks and benefits, and their right to withdraw at any time without consequences. The consent form received IRB approval to ensure it conforms to ethical standards.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Conflict of Interest Declaration\n",
      "**Current Text**: \"None reported.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggested Revision**: \"The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest related to this study. Any financial relationships or affiliations that could be perceived as potential conflicts of interest have been disclosed and reviewed by the IRB.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Data Privacy\n",
      "**Suggested Addition**: \"The study was conducted in compliance with data privacy regulations, including GDPR and HIPAA. All patient data were anonymized and securely stored in accordance with these regulations. Data access was restricted to authorized personnel only, and data protection measures included encryption and secure password protocols.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### Adverse Events Reporting\n",
      "\n",
      "**Current Text**: \"Adverse events were reported in 30% of the CardioX group, compared to 25% in the placebo group. Most common adverse events in the CardioX group included mild gastrointestinal symptoms and transient dizziness. Serious adverse events were comparable between groups, with no significant differences detected.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggested Addition**: \"Adverse events were categorized by severity as mild, moderate, or severe. Mild events included symptoms like minor gastrointestinal disturbances and dizziness. Serious adverse events were defined as any event resulting in hospitalization, being life-threatening, or requiring discontinuation of the study drug. Detailed accounting of serious adverse events showed no significant differences between groups (specific numbers and nature of events need to be included).\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### Risk-Benefit Analysis\n",
      "**Suggested Addition**: \"While CardioX demonstrated significant improvements in cardiac function and quality of life, the incidence of adverse events was slightly higher in the treatment group (30% vs. 25%). A comprehensive risk-benefit analysis suggests that, given the benefits observed, the adverse events are manageable. However, ongoing monitoring is essential to ensure patient safety. Future studies should further evaluate long-term risks and benefits.\"\n",

      "## Title: Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of CardioX in the Treatment of Heart Disease\n",
      "\n",
      "### Abstract\n",
      "This study investigates the effects of a new drug, CardioX, on heart disease. Conducted over a period of 12 months, the research involved 500 patients diagnosed with varying stages of heart disease. Participants were randomly assigned to either the CardioX group or a placebo group. Efficacy was assessed through changes in key cardiovascular biomarkers and patient symptoms, while safety was monitored through adverse event reporting. Results indicated that CardioX significantly improved cardiac function and patient-reported symptoms with a manageable safety profile, suggesting its potential as a new treatment option for heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Introduction\n",
      "Heart disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CardioX, a novel pharmaceutical agent designed to enhance cardiac function and reduce symptoms associated with heart disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Methodology\n",
      "#### Study Design\n",
      "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), specifically the [Name of IRB Committee], under IRB approval number [IRB Number]. The trial was conducted in adherence to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Participants\n",
      "500 patients aged 40-75 with clinically diagnosed heart disease were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or other severe systemic illnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Informed Consent Process\n",
      "Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study through a comprehensive consent process. Participants received written and verbal explanations regarding the study‚Äôs purpose, procedures, potential risks and benefits, and their right to withdraw at any time without consequences. The consent form received IRB approval to ensure it conforms to ethical standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Randomization and Blinding\n",
      "Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CardioX (100 mg daily) or a matching placebo. Randomization was computer-generated, and both participants and researchers were blinded to the group assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Interventions\n",
      "CardioX or placebo was administered orally once daily for 12 months. Adherence to treatment was assessed through pill counts and patient diaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Outcome Measures\n",
      "Primary outcomes included changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and levels of biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and the frequency of adverse events.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Statistical Analysis\n",
      "Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat principles. Continuous variables were compared using paired t-tests, and categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. Missing data were addressed using multiple imputation methods to preserve the integrity of the dataset. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the findings under various assumptions. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Results\n",
      "500 participants were randomized, with 250 in each group. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Efficacy\n",
      "- Mean LVEF improved by 12% in the CardioX group compared to 4% in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- BNP levels decreased by 30% in the CardioX group, significantly more than the 10% reduction observed in the placebo group (p<0.001).\n",
      "- The KCCQ scores improved by an average of 15 points in the CardioX group, compared to 5 points in the placebo group (p<0.05).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Safety\n",
      "Adverse events were categorized by severity as mild, moderate, or severe. Mild events included symptoms like minor gastrointestinal disturbances and dizziness. Serious adverse events were defined as any event resulting in hospitalization, being life-threatening, or requiring discontinuation of the study drug. Detailed accounting of serious adverse events showed no significant differences between groups, with five events in the CardioX group and four in the placebo group.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Discussion\n",
      "CardioX significantly improved key measures of cardiac function and patient quality of life compared to placebo, supporting its efficacy in the treatment of heart disease. The manageable safety profile observed aligns with expectations for a novel therapeutic agent. The study's strengths include a robust randomized controlled design and comprehensive outcome assessments. \n",
      "\n",
      "While CardioX demonstrated significant improvements in cardiac function and quality of life, the incidence of adverse events was slightly higher in the treatment group (30% vs. 25%). A comprehensive risk-benefit analysis suggests that, given the benefits observed, the adverse events are manageable. However, ongoing monitoring is essential to ensure patient safety. Future studies should further evaluate long-term risks and benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "This study demonstrates that CardioX is a promising new treatment for heart disease, offering significant improvements in cardiac function and patient quality of life. Future studies should focus on long-term outcomes and comparisons with existing therapies to further establish CardioX‚Äôs role in the management of heart disease.\n",

Although the number of published studies is still relatively low, the preliminary results are very promising and in a near future, an augmented dentomaxillofacial radiology (ADMFR) will combine the use of radiomics-based and AI-based analyses with the radiologist's evaluation.

When giving concern towards the big picture by combining the observations, it is noticeable that computational\\nbiology and biomedicine-based decision making in healthcare have now become dependent on machine learning algorithms, and\\nthus they cannot be separated from the Ô¨Åeld of artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence.\\n1. Introduction\\nArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence includes approaches and techniques\\nlike machine learning, machine reasoning, and robotics. In\\nthis review, the main concern will be given towards machine\\nlearning as it is the approach that is being applied using\\ndiÔ¨Äerent techniques and algorithms in various healthcare\\nactivities. Te use of machine learning to solve clinical\\nproblems is called revolutionary clinical decision making.\\nWhen machine learning is being used in clinical decision\\nHindawi\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\nVolume 2021, Article ID 6679512, 20 pages\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6679512\\nmaking, it implies that the system will perceive a given\\nindividual by collecting and interpreting data relevant for\\nthe health of that individual and it will reason on the data to\\nsuggest the best actions that need to be performed to\\nmaintain or improve the individual‚Äôs health. In machine\\nlearning, the system needs to learn the context of the\\nproblem and the quality of data provided. Normally, these\\nalgorithms are not very strong and concrete at the beginning,\\nbut by performing a single and repetitive task, the algorithm\\nbecomes\\nstrong\\nwith\\nincreased\\nnumber\\nof\\nprevious\\nexperiences.\\nTere are two distinct ways that a clinical decision-\\nmaking solution interprets by comparing previous knowl-\\nedge that is included in the dataset. One is the fast or in-\\ntuitive approach which uses underlying clinical pattern\\nrecognition and is typically used in medical emergencies. But\\nthese have a higher possibility of being erroneous and\\nprovide incomplete perception. Te other approach is the\\nslow or reasoned method. It is deductive, deliberate, and\\nneeds greater intellectual, time, and cost information. But\\nthe decisions made are more accurate. As all these decisions\\nare based on the data that are being collected, analysed, and\\nstored in complex and heterogeneous forms, it is important\\nto use algorithmic approaches to minimize the computing\\npower required. Machine learning applications have cur-\\nrently contributed massively to the healthcare sector\\nworldwide to improve its quality and will continue to do so\\n[1].\\nIt is also important to mention that when discussing\\ncomputational decision making in the healthcare sector, it is\\nnot always about detecting or predicting diseases, bio-\\nmedicine, biomedical image analysis, etc., but also about\\nhow to perform medical treatment research, patient care,\\nallocating resources, managing hospital volume, public\\nhealth policymaking, and much more. As an example, when\\nconsidering the current situation that has arisen with\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, it could be seen that all the afore-\\nmentioned points need to be considered in healthcare and\\nthose tasks need to be performed within a considerably small\\ntime period. Terefore, the best approach is to use machine\\nlearning-based decision making in the healthcare sector in\\nsuch times. Tis is the reason why there is a demand for the\\narea ‚Äúemergency machine learning‚Äù in the present world [2].\\nEven though artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence is set to make trans-\\nformation by playing an important role in healthcare, there\\nare a few ethical aspects as well that need to be considered\\nwhen implementing such systems and obtaining decisions\\nfrom them. Few of the ethical issues are the accountability\\nand transparency of the decisions made by such systems, the\\npotential for group harms arising from algorithmic bias and\\nthe professional roles, and the integrity of the clinicians.\\nTerefore, it is important to give consideration when\\nimplementing such systems and balance them with the\\nbeneÔ¨Åt that they create with more eÔ¨Écient healthcare sys-\\ntems by the high and accurate computational power of\\nartiÔ¨Åcial intelligence at a considerably low cost. Moreover,\\nalgorithms in artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence have the capacity to\\nperform computerized predictive analysis by Ô¨Åltering, or-\\ndering, and searching for patterns from big datasets from\\nmultiple sources to provide fast and informed decisions. In\\nthe present context, due to this discussed matter, most ju-\\nrisdictions do not allow directly applying these algorithms to\\nmake the Ô¨Ånal decisions, but instead use them as an aid for\\ndiagnosis [3].\\nTroughout the paper many machine learning algo-\\nrithms and their applications in the Ô¨Åeld of computational\\ndecision making for healthcare will be discussed along with\\nthe methods that are used to improve the eÔ¨Éciency of the\\nalgorithms with the objective to highlight the importance of\\nscalable machine learning algorithms in healthcare appli-\\ncations. Te aim of the paper is to discuss the involvement of\\nmachine learning algorithms in the healthcare sector to\\nperform computational decision making starting from the\\ninitial phase where machine learning was introduced to\\ncomputational biology till the peak it currently stands which\\nis the introduction of precision medicine to the Ô¨Åeld of\\nbiomedicine. Tis paper is organized in diÔ¨Äerent sections.\\nMachine learning approaches and algorithms that are being\\napplied in healthcare for decision making will be discussed\\nin Section 2 followed by the applications of machine learning\\nin the healthcare sector in various aspects such as disease\\nprediction\\nand\\ndetection,\\nmedical\\nimaging,\\nmachine\\nlearning in biomedicine, biomedical event extraction, ma-\\nchine learning approaches to polypharmacology, and ma-\\nchine learning for drug repurposing using system biology.\\nTe discussion section will include an evaluation and\\ncomparison of machine learning algorithms with regard to\\nthe applications of these algorithms in healthcare which will\\nbe followed by recognition of diÔ¨Äerent mechanisms used to\\nenhance the accuracy of the algorithms within applications,\\nalong with further information on the involvement of\\nscalable machine learning algorithms for computational\\ndecision making in healthcare. Te latter part of the paper\\nconsists of the conclusion.\\n2. Machine Learning Approaches\\nand Algorithms\\nMachine learning can be introduced as a scientiÔ¨Åc discipline\\nthat focuses on how computers learn from data and con-\\ntinuously improve themselves. It is mainly based on prob-\\nability and statistics. But it is more powerful than the\\nstandard statistical methodologies when it comes to decision\\nmaking. Information gathered from a dataset which is being\\ngiven to the algorithm is called features. Te accuracy of the\\npredictions made by the model is dependent on the quality\\nof the features provided to the algorithm. It is the duty of a\\nmachine learning developer to detect the subset of features\\nthat could best Ô¨Åt the purpose, increasing the accuracy of the\\nmodel. Tis is not an easy task. Continuous experiments\\nshould be carried out to identify the said feature subset for\\nthe algorithm. When considering putting a machine\\nlearning algorithm to applications, there are basically three\\nsteps to follow, which are training, testing, and validation.\\nTraining is important as the accuracy of the results will be\\ndepending on the training dataset. Using the test dataset, the\\nperformance of the algorithm will be measured. When using\\nthe test data for measuring the performance, it is also\\n2\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\nimportant to lower the bias and to increase the variance in\\nthis testing period. A good machine learning algorithm must\\noptimize the bias-variance trade-oÔ¨Ä. Te evaluation of the\\nÔ¨Ånal machine learning algorithm performance is done based\\non the validation dataset in the validation period [4]. As a\\nstart, it would be better to have an idea about various ap-\\nproaches taken in machine learning along with several al-\\ngorithms that are being used excessively for clustering and\\nclassiÔ¨Åcation purposes in machine learning.\\n2.1. Supervised Learning. In supervised learning, a training\\nset is provided with appropriate objectives in this approach.\\nClassiÔ¨Åcation and regression are the two categories found in\\nsupervised learning. In classiÔ¨Åcation, with the use of clas-\\nsiÔ¨Åcation methods, the trained system allocates inputs into\\nclasses. In regression, the sources are continuous rather than\\ndiscrete. Te root-mean-squared error is being used to\\nevaluate regression predictions, while accuracy is being used\\nto\\nevaluate\\nclassiÔ¨Åcation\\npredictions.\\n[5].\\nSupervised\\nlearning has the goal of predicting a known output based on\\na common dataset. Tasks performed by supervised learning\\ncan most of the time be performed by a trained person as\\nwell. Supervised learning focuses on classiÔ¨Åcation which\\ninvolves choosing among subgroups to best describe a new\\ninstance of data and prediction, which involves estimating\\nan unknown parameter. Tis is often used to estimate and\\nmodel risk while Ô¨Ånding relationships which are not readily\\nvisible to humans [6]. Below are a few supervised learning\\nalgorithms which are widely used in the Ô¨Åeld of computa-\\ntional biology and biomedicine.\\n2.1.1. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN). KNN is a popular su-\\npervised classiÔ¨Åcation algorithm which is used in many Ô¨Åelds\\nsuch as pattern recognition, intrusion detection, and so on.\\nKNN is a simple algorithm which is easy to understand. Even\\nthe accuracy is high in KNN, but the issues are that it is\\ncomputationally expensive and it has a high memory re-\\nquirement as both testing and training data need to be stored\\n[7]. A prediction for a new instance is obtained by Ô¨Ånding\\nthe most similar instances at Ô¨Årst and then summarizing the\\noutput variable according to those similar instances. For\\nregression, this can be the mean value, and for classiÔ¨Åcation,\\nthis may be the mode value. To determine the similar in-\\nstance, the distance measure is used. Euclidean distance is\\nthe most popular approach used to calculate the distance.\\nTe training dataset should be vectors in a multidimensional\\nfeature space, each with a class label [5].\\n2.1.2. Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a supervised\\nmachine learning algorithm which is used to address mainly\\nclassiÔ¨Åcation problems but also used for regression issues. In\\nthis algorithm, initially, the data items are plotted as points\\nin an n-dimensional space with the feature value being the\\nparticular coordinate. Ten, it identiÔ¨Åes the hyperplane that\\nseparates the datapoints into two classes. By this, the\\nmarginal distance between the decision hyperplane and\\ninstances that are close to the boundary can be maximized\\n[5].What brings SVM ahead of other algorithms is that it has\\nbasic functions that can map points to other dimensions by\\nusing nonlinear relationships [8]. As it divides the data-\\npoints to two classes, SVM is also known as the non-\\nprobabilistic binary classiÔ¨Åer. SVM has more accuracy when\\ncompared with many other algorithms. But it is best suited\\nfor problems with small datasets. Te reason is that when the\\ndataset keeps on getting larger, the training becomes more\\ncomplex and time consuming. When data have noise, it\\ncannot perform well. To make the classiÔ¨Åcation more eÔ¨É-\\ncient, SVM uses a subset of training points. SVM is capable\\nof solving both linear and nonlinear problems, but nonlinear\\nSVM is preferred over linear SVM as it has better perfor-\\nmance [7].\\n2.1.3. Decision Trees (DTs). DT is a supervised algorithm\\nwhich has a tree like model where decisions, possible\\nconsequences, and their outcomes are being considered.\\nEach node carries a question, and each branch represents an\\noutcome. Te leaf nodes are class labels. When a leaf node is\\nbeing reached by a sample data, the label of the corre-\\nsponding node will be assigned to the sample. Tis approach\\nis suited when the problem is simple and when the dataset is\\nsmall. Even though the algorithm is easy to understand, it\\nhas certain issues such as the overÔ¨Åtting problem and biased\\noutcomes when working with imbalanced datasets. But DTis\\ncapable of mapping both linear and nonlinear relationships\\n[7].\\n2.1.4. ClassiÔ¨Åcation and Regression Trees (CARTs). CART is\\na predictive model from which the output value is predicted\\nbased on the existing values in the constructed tree. Te\\nrepresentation for the CARTmodel is a binary tree in which\\neach root represents a single input and a split point on that\\nvariable. Leaf nodes contain an output which is used to make\\npredictions [5].\\n2.1.5. Logistic Regression (LR). LR is a popular mathematical\\nmodelling procedure which is used for epidemiologic\\ndatasets in the area of machine learning. It Ô¨Årst calculates\\nusing the logistic function. Ten, it learns the coeÔ¨Écients for\\nthe logistic regression model and then Ô¨Ånally makes pre-\\ndictions using that logistic regression model [9]. Tis model\\nis a generalized linear model and has two parts, namely,\\nlinear part and link function. Te linear part is responsible\\nfor carrying out the calculations of the classiÔ¨Åcation model,\\nand the link function is responsible for delivering the output\\nof the calculation [10]. LR is a supervised machine learning\\nalgorithm which needs a hypothesis and a cost function. It is\\nto be noted that optimizing the cost function is important\\n[11].\\n2.1.6. Random Forest Algorithm (RFA). RFA is a trending\\nmachine learning technique which is capable of both re-\\ngression and classiÔ¨Åcation [12]. It is a supervised learning\\nalgorithm in which the ground methodology is recursion. In\\nthis algorithm, a group of decision trees are being created\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\n3\\nand the bagging method is used for training purposes [13].\\nRFA is insensitive to noise and can be used for imbalanced\\ndatasets. Te problem of overÔ¨Åtting is also not prominent in\\nRFA [7].\\n2.1.7. Naive Bayes (NB). NB is a classiÔ¨Åcation algorithm\\nwhich is used for binary and multiclass problems. Te NB\\nclassiÔ¨Åers are a collection of classifying algorithms that are\\nbased on the Bayes theorem. But they all adhere to a\\ncommon principle which is every pair of features being\\nclassiÔ¨Åed must be independent of each other [5]. Tis is a bit\\nsimilar to SVM, but the process takes advantage from sta-\\ntistical methods. In this method, when there is a new input,\\nthe probabilistic value will be calculated among the classes\\nwith regard to the given input and the data will be labelled\\nwith the class which has the highest probabilistic value for\\nthe given input [9].\\n2.1.8. ArtiÔ¨Åcial Neural Network (ANN). ANN is a supervised\\nmachine learning approach which is well known for image\\nclassiÔ¨Åcation problems. In machine learning, artiÔ¨Åcial\\nneurons are considered to be the basic concept of ANN and\\nit is similar to a biological neural network. Tere are 3 layers\\nin an ANN, and every node in each layer is connected with\\nall the nodes in the other layers. By increasing the number of\\nhidden layers, a deeper neural network can be created [14].\\nIn neural networks, there are three types of functions. Error\\nfunction will determine how good or bad the output was for\\na given set of inputs. Te search function will identify the\\nchanges that would reduce the error function. Update\\nfunction will determine how the changes will be made as per\\nthe search function. Tis is an iterative process that would\\nimprove the performance of the algorithm [8].\\n2.2.UnsupervisedLearning. When a developer does not have\\na clear understanding of the data that are involved with the\\nsystem, it is not possible to label the data and provide them\\nas the training dataset. In these cases, the machine learning\\nalgorithms themselves can be used to detect similarities and\\ndiÔ¨Äerences between the data objects. Tis is the unsupervised\\napproach of machine learning. In this method, existing\\npatterns will be identiÔ¨Åed and the data will be clustered\\naccording to the identiÔ¨Åed patterns [4]. Terefore, in un-\\nsupervised learning, the system makes decisions without\\nbeing trained by a dataset as no labelled data are being given\\nto the system which could be used for predictions [5]. It is to\\nbe noted that unsupervised learning is an attempt to Ô¨Ånd\\nnaturally occurring patterns or groups within data. Te\\nchallenging part in it is to Ô¨Ånd whether the recognized\\npatterns or groups are useful in some way. Tis is the reason\\nfor unsupervised learning to play a major role in precision\\nmedicine. As a simple example, when grouping individuals\\naccording to their genetics, environment, and medical\\nhistory, certain relationships among them which were not\\nvisible before might get identiÔ¨Åed by unsupervised machine\\nlearning algorithms [6]. K-means, mean shift, aÔ¨Énity\\npropagation, density-based spatial clustering of applications\\nwith noise (DBSCAN), Gaussian mixture modelling, Mar-\\nkov random Ô¨Åelds, iterative self-organizing data (ISO-\\nDATA), and fuzzy C-means systems are a few examples for\\nunsupervised algorithms [8].\\nClustering is an approach in unsupervised learning, and\\nit can be used for dividing inputs into clusters. But these\\nclusters are not identiÔ¨Åed initially but are grouped based on\\nresemblance [5]. In clustering, the root approaches are\\nseparated as per the diÔ¨Äerent features that they carry. Tey\\ncan be partitioning (k-means), hierarchical, grid-based,\\ndensity-based, or model-based, and they can be further\\ndivided as numerical, discrete, and mixed data types. In-\\nheritance relationships between clustering algorithms within\\nan approach show common features and improvements that\\nthey make on each other. Speed, minimal parameters, ro-\\nbustness to noise, outliers, redundancy handling, and object\\norder independence are the desired clustering features which\\nare required in a clustering algorithm to be implemented\\nwithin a biomedical application [15]. Clustering algorithms\\nare used when datasets are too large and complex for manual\\nanalysis. Terefore, they must be fast and they must not be\\naÔ¨Äected by redundant sequences. It is important to evaluate a\\nclustering algorithm to know whether it is suitable for the\\nproblem in hand by considering features such as\\n(1) Scalability: runtime\\nand\\nmemory\\nrequirements\\nshould not exceed when working with large datasets.\\n(2) Robustness: ability to detect outliers that are diÔ¨Äerent\\nfrom the rest of the samples.\\n(3) Order insensitivity: the order that the inputs are\\ngiven should not be aÔ¨Äecting the Ô¨Ånal output.\\n(4) Minimum\\nuser-speciÔ¨Åed\\ninput:\\nthe\\nminimum\\nnumber of parameters that should be provided.\\n(5) Mixed data types: the objects provided may have\\ndiÔ¨Äerent data types.\\n(6) Arbitrary-shaped cluster: ability to Ô¨Ånd arbitrary-\\nshaped clusters.\\n(7) Point proportion admissibility: duplicating objects\\nand reclustering should not change the result [15].\\nWhen giving concern to the above factors, it is to be\\nnoted that as a result of the use of unsupervised machine\\nlearning in healthcare, when a patient is being diagnosed for\\na speciÔ¨Åc disease, in that process itself the patient will be\\nidentiÔ¨Åed of another disease as well if any such disease is\\npresent. Te reason is that the algorithm has learnt itself on\\nfacts that need to be considered for various types of diseases\\nand it analyses the given data and categorizes as diseases\\naccording to those data. In addition, even though various\\nreports taken to identify diseases may include diÔ¨Äerent types\\nof data, using this approach, all these data can be analysed\\nsimultaneously which is of much convenience and also time\\nsaving. With regard to the aforementioned aspects, there is\\nno doubt that healthcare decision making is highly beneÔ¨Åted\\nfrom the unsupervised machine learning approach.\\n2.2.1. Partition Clustering. In partition clustering, the ob-\\njects are partitioned and may change clusters based on the\\n4\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\ndissimilarity. It is useful in bioinformatics when the number\\nof clusters is decided such as for a small gene expression\\ndataset. Te drawback is that the user needs to manually\\nenter the number of clusters as an input. But this approach is\\ncommonly\\nused\\nin\\nbioinformatics.\\nFuzzy\\nk-means,\\nCOOLCAT, clustering large applications (CLARA), and\\nclustering large applications based on randomized search\\n(CLARANS) are a few examples for partition clustering\\nalgorithms [15].\\n2.2.2. Graph-Based Clustering. Graph-based clustering is\\nused in interactomes to make complex predictions and to\\nsequence networks. Tis approach is often slow and sensitive\\nto user-speciÔ¨Åed parameters. super-paramagnetic clustering\\n(SPC), Markov cluster algorithm (MCL), molecular complex\\ndetection (MCODE), and restricted neighbourhood search\\ncluster (RNSC) are a few examples for graph-based clus-\\ntering algorithms [15].\\n2.2.3. Hierarchical Clustering. In hierarchical clustering, the\\nobjects are partitioned into a tree of nodes and these nodes\\nare considered as clusters. Tere are parent nodes and child\\nnodes. A node could have just one parent, and each node can\\nhave zero or more child nodes. Tis approach is popular in\\nbioinformatics as clusters can be navigated at various levels\\nof granularity. Te drawbacks are that they are often slow,\\nerrors made when merging clusters cannot be undone even\\nthough it aÔ¨Äects the result, and if large clusters are merged,\\nthen interesting local cluster structure may be lost. Tis\\napproach is used to represent protein sequence family re-\\nlationships and also could be used to show gene relations\\nreÔ¨Çecting their gene similarity. Chameleon, robust clustering\\nusing\\nlinks\\n(ROCK),\\nscalable\\ninformation\\nbottleneck\\n(LIMBO), and spectral are a few examples for hierarchical\\nclustering algorithms [15].\\n2.2.4. Density-Based Clustering. Density-based clustering\\nuses a local density criterion, and the clusters are subspaces\\nin which the objects are dense and are separated by sub-\\nspaces of low density. It is used in bioinformatics to Ô¨Ånd the\\ndensest subspaces in interactome networks, typically in-\\nvolving cliques. Time eÔ¨Éciency and the ability to Ô¨Ånd\\nclusters of arbitrary shapes are the advantages of this ap-\\nproach. Some of these algorithms accept user parameters,\\nbut it is not the number of clusters. Ordering points to\\nidentify the clustering structure (OPTICS), clustering in\\nquest (CLIQUE), density based clustering (DENCLUE), and\\nclustering categorical data using summaries (CACTUS) are a\\nfew examples for density-based clustering algorithms [15].\\n2.2.5. Model-Based Clustering. In model-based clustering, it\\nis assumed that objects match a model which is often a\\nstatistical distribution. Te model can be user speciÔ¨Åed using\\na parameter, and this model can even be changed in the\\nprocess. Tis approach can be found in bioinformatics to\\nintegrate background knowledge into gene expressions,\\ninteractomes, and sequences. Slow processing time on large\\ndatasets is a drawback of this method. If the user assump-\\ntions are false when deÔ¨Åning the models, then the results will\\nalso be inaccurate. SVM-based clustering, COBWEB, and\\nAutoClass are a few model-based clustering algorithms [15].\\n2.3.SemisupervisedLearning. For semisupervised learning, a\\npartial training set of data is provided. Tis type of training is\\nused when some missing results could be targeted by some\\ntraining data. Semisupervised learning algorithms are\\ntrained on both labelled and unlabelled data. Due to this\\nreason, it exhibits the features of both supervised and un-\\nsupervised machine learning algorithms [16].\\n2.4. Evolutionary Learning. Evolutionary learning is mainly\\nused in the biology Ô¨Åeld to learn about biological organisms\\nand predict their survival rate. Using this method, the level\\nof correctness of a result can also be predicted [16].\\n2.5. Active Learning. In active learning, the system gets the\\ntraining tags only for a restricted set of occurrences. By using\\nit, the optimality of the substances can be enhanced to gain\\ntags for the required goal. Te advantage in this approach is\\nthat the algorithm not only continuously learns but also gets\\nthe facts which were self-learnt approved either by querying\\na user or an information source in an interactive manner. It\\nis something similar to budget functions in an organization\\nand is a modern machine learning approach for decision\\nmaking [16].\\n2.6. Deep Learning. Deep learning is an advanced phase of\\nmachine learning which evolves around neural networks for\\nlearning and predicting data. Using this approach, complex\\ngeneralized systems can be implemented which are able to\\naccept any type of problem and give predictions regarding it\\n[16].\\n2.7. Reinforcement Learning. In reinforcement learning, the\\ntraining data are provided only as a response to the pro-\\ngram‚Äôs activities in a self-motivated situation. It has a\\ncontinuous learning process from the environment in an\\niterative fashion [13].\\nAfter discussing several machine learning approaches, it\\nwould be better to list down a few examples on the appli-\\ncations of machine learning in the Ô¨Åeld of biomedicine so\\nthat this review will be interesting from the very beginning.\\nIn neuroscience, machine learning classiÔ¨Åers are being used\\nto study functional and structural dynamics of the brain.\\nMachine learning approaches are used in cancer prediction\\nand prognosis. SVM classiÔ¨Åers are used to detect prostate\\ncancer. Hierarchical clustering has been used in investiga-\\ntion of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. ANN has been used in classi-\\nfying diÔ¨Äerent subtypes of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures\\n[4]. With the knowledge gathered on various machine\\nlearning approaches and machine learning algorithms which\\nare mostly connected with computational biology and\\nbiomedicine, now it is time to dive into deeper knowledge\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\n5\\nand to identify the applications of these algorithms in the\\ndiscussing Ô¨Åeld.\\n3. Machine Learning in Disease Prediction\\nand Detection\\nVarious machine learning approaches have been imple-\\nmented to predict or detect a disease at its early stages so that\\nthe treatment for it would be less complex and it would\\nincrease the probability of the patient being cured. As a\\nresult of these approaches, diÔ¨Äerent types of diseases have\\nbeen detected but with diverse accuracy levels depending on\\nfactors such as the used algorithm, feature set, training\\ndataset, and so on. In this section, a few selected diseases will\\nbe discussed as examples, along with the importance of\\nidentifying a disease at the earliest, the machine learning\\nmethods implemented to detect the disease, and the features\\nthat were considered to make predictions. A descriptive\\ncomparison of the machine learning approaches which have\\nbeen implemented will be conducted in the discussion\\nsection of the paper, followed by suggestions to further\\nimprove them.\\n3.1.Cancer. Human body has the right count of cells of each\\ntype. Cancer begins with abrupt changes in the cell orga-\\nnization. Signals which are being generated by cells deter-\\nmine the control and division of cells. When these signals\\nbecome faulty, cells multiply too much which form a lump\\ncalled tumour. Nowadays, thermography is more reliable as\\nit is noninvasive and nonionizing. With the emerging\\ntechnology, it has been producing eÔ¨Écient and positive\\nresults which have made it superior over other technologies.\\nFrom the thermographic images, with the use of feature\\nextraction techniques and machine learning techniques, the\\npresence of cancer cells can be detected. Scale invariant\\nfeature transform (SIFT) and speeded up robust feature\\n(SURF) techniques can be used to extract features from\\nimages. Using principal component analysis (PCA), the\\nfeatures could be further Ô¨Åltered in order to make better\\ninterpretations [7].\\n3.1.1. Breast Cancer. Breast cancer is a type of cancer that is\\nmostly seen in women and is a leading cause for women‚Äôs\\ndeath. But this can be reduced by early detection of can-\\ncerous cells by tests like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),\\nmammogram, ultrasound, and biopsy. Breast cancer is di-\\nagnosed by classifying the tumour. Tumours can be either\\nbenign or malignant. It is to be noted that malignant tu-\\nmours are more harmful than benign tumours. But it is not\\nan easy task for physicians to distinguish among these tu-\\nmours. Tis makes machine learning algorithms important\\nas they can automatically learn and improve from the ex-\\nperiences without being explicitly programmed [5].\\nIn the past years, many machine learning techniques\\nwere developed for breast cancer detection and classiÔ¨Åca-\\ntion. Teir process could be analysed in three stages which\\nare preprocessing, feature extraction, and classiÔ¨Åcation.\\nFeature extraction stage is important as it helps in\\ndiscriminating between benign and malignant tumours.\\nTen, the image properties such as smoothness, coarseness,\\ndepth, and regularity are extracted using segmentation [17].\\nNormally, images are converted to binary to extract\\nuseful information. But it has been observed that once doing\\nso, some important features in the image vanished which\\nomits crucial information. Tis has led to keeping the images\\nin the grey scale format. Using discrete wavelet transfor-\\nmation (DWT), the images can be transformed from the\\ntime domain to the frequency domain. Tis wavelet de-\\ncomposition contains four matrices which are the approx-\\nimation coeÔ¨Écient matrix, the horizontal detailed coeÔ¨Écient\\nmatrix, the vertical detailed coeÔ¨Écient matrix, and the di-\\nagonal detailed coeÔ¨Écient matrix. Tese are the values that\\nwill be used for the machine learning algorithms [11].\\n3.1.2. Lung Cancer. Lung cancer can initiate in the wind-\\npipe, main airway, or lungs. People with emphysema and\\nprevious chest problems have a higher probability of being\\ndiagnosed with lung cancer. Tobacco, smoking, and air\\npollution can be a few major risk factors for lung cancer.\\nLung cancer starts in the lungs at the primary stage and\\nspreads to other organs as the secondary stage. Symptoms of\\nlung cancer will not be shown until the disease is quite\\nadvanced. Tat is what makes it more dangerous [9].\\nComputerized tomography (CT) reports are less noisy as\\ncompared to MRI and X-ray reports. Grayscale conversion,\\nnoise reduction, binarization, and segmentation techniques\\nare important to get the image in the required form with less\\nnoise and distortion. When converting to grey scale, the\\naverage of RGB is taken. Te median Ô¨Ålter is used for noise\\nreduction. Segmentation removes unnecessary details from\\nthe images and locates the objects and the boundaries. In\\nfeature extraction stage, features such as area, perimeter, and\\neccentricity are considered [18].\\nSmall-cell lung cancer (SCLC) detection is extremely\\ndiÔ¨Écult for human as it is almost identical to the one\\nwithout. Tis is where the machine learning algorithms\\nsuch as convolution neural network- (CNN-) based deep\\nlearning methods could be used in detecting SCLC.\\nUsually, deep learning algorithms require large training\\ndatasets which is an issue. Entropy degradation method\\n(EDM) can be used to overcome the said matter. Te\\ntraining data and testing data need to be high-resolution\\nlung CTscans. EDM carries the concept of shallow neural\\nnetwork where vectorized histograms are converted to\\nscores. Ten, the scores are transformed to probability\\nusing logistic function. In this approach, SCLC detection\\nis considered as a binomial problem which contains only\\ntwo groups: either a healthy person or a lung cancer\\npatient. So, initially test data are also given with both\\nthese types. Tis approach is reasonably accurate but not\\nthe best, and there is a large space to be further improved.\\nBut it is recommended that it could be further improved\\nby providing a larger training set and a deeper network.\\nBy combining with CNN, the image processing is also\\nfurther improved for better detection as CNN is being\\nused in many applications of CT imaging [19].\\n6\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\n3.1.3. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia. Acute lymphoblastic\\nleukaemia (ALL) is a type of cancer where a large number of\\nimmature lymphocyte blood cells develop and they aÔ¨Äect the\\nproduction of other blood cells. Tis progresses rapidly and\\ncan be very fatal within a month or a week. Pale colour of\\nskin, patient feeling very tired, lymph node getting enlarged,\\nfever, and joint pain are a few symptoms that were identiÔ¨Åed\\nin the patients who were diagnosed with ALL. Machine\\nlearning algorithms play a vital role when trying to auto-\\nmatically segment and classify microscopic images to detect\\nleukaemia.\\nTere have been various machine learning algorithms\\nused for leukaemia detection such as KNN, SVM, NB, radial\\nbasis function network (RBFN), and multilayer perceptron\\n(MLP). But in all these approaches, there are basically four\\nsections which are preprocessing, feature extraction, clas-\\nsiÔ¨Åcation model building, and evaluation of the classiÔ¨Åer. In\\nthe preprocessing stage, cropping of the image will be done\\nso that the region of interest (ROI) is clearly visible and the\\nunwanted information is eliminated. Using the Gaussian\\nblur smoothing technique, the images can be further pro-\\ncessed to enhance the picture by reducing the noise. In the\\nfeature extraction stage, concern is given towards colour-\\nbased features, geometrical features, statistical features,\\nHaralick texture feature, image moments, local binary\\npattern, and presence of adjacent cells [20].\\n3.2. Diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic disease, and it needs to\\nbe identiÔ¨Åed at the early stages for correct medication.\\nDiabetes is caused when the sugar ratio in blood increases.\\nTis makes the life complicated for the patients due to many\\nreasons. Diabetes can be classiÔ¨Åed under three types, namely,\\ndiabetes 1, diabetes 2, and gestation diabetes.\\nDiscriminant analysis (DA) is a procedure in which the\\nclass label of an input is determined by a series of equations\\nthat are obtained by input features. Normally, DA uses two\\npossible objectives which are Ô¨Ånding a related equation for\\nclassifying test samples and interpretation of the predictive\\nequation to better understand the relationship among fea-\\ntures. Being pregnant, the weight of the patient, blood\\npressure, glucose concentration, the ratio of insulin in blood,\\ndiabetes pedigree function (DPF), skinfold thickness, and\\npatient age are some features which can be considered for\\nthe classiÔ¨Åcation [10].\\nBy using machine learning algorithms such as Gaussian\\nNaive Bayes (GNB), LR, KNN, CART, RFA, and SVM along\\nwith variables in electronic medical records (EMRs) such as\\nserum-glucose1, serum-glucose2 levels, body mass index\\n(BMI), age, race, gender, creatinine level, and so on, pre-\\ndiction of type 2 diabetics was possible [21]. Time to time\\nvarious machine learning techniques were used to try and\\nimprove the accuracy of the predictions made. One ap-\\nproach was made using neural networks. In this method, a\\nfeed-forward neural network was trained by a back-\\npropagation algorithm. Even in this approach, the features\\nthat were considered are the number of pregnancies,\\nskinfold thickness, serum-insulin, BMI, DPF, and age and\\nthe main feature considered was the plasma-glucose level. It\\nwas observed that the predictions made by using neural\\nnetworks showed a higher accuracy, when compared with\\nother machine learning algorithms [22]. Research has been\\ncarried out on using deep neural networks (DNNs) as well\\nfor prediction of diabetics by training the DNN using Ô¨Åve-\\nfold and ten-fold cross validation. It is to be highlighted that\\nboth aforementioned approaches which were taken using\\nneural networks have shown an accuracy near 97% in di-\\nabetes prediction [23].\\n3.3. Heart Diseases. Heart diseases are severe events which\\nare caused by blockage inside the heart arteries. Chronic\\nheart disease is the rise of plaque inside the coronary arteries.\\nTis progresses slowly and could lead to a heart attack.\\nPeculiar glucose metabolism, extreme blood pressure, dys-\\nlipidaemia, smoking, lack of physical exercise, and age are\\nfew risk factors that have been identiÔ¨Åed for major heart\\ndiseases. Symptoms of a heart disease may include shortness\\nof breath, weakness of physical body, swollen feet and fatigue\\nwith related signs, and so on [14].\\nIn the Ô¨Åeld of cardiology, the tasks that precision\\nmedicine has performed include diagnostics as well as\\ntherapeutics in various subÔ¨Åelds. Interventional cardiology,\\npersonalized treatment options in correcting heart rhythms,\\nsome gender diÔ¨Äerences aÔ¨Äecting the outcome of cardio-\\nvascular diseases, and numerous works done in genomics\\ncan be highlighted as areas in which tasks have been per-\\nformed by precision medicine in cardiology. Nowadays, in\\nhealthcare informatics, there are services such as patient\\nmonitoring and clinical decision support systems (CDSSs).\\nWith the advancement of machine learning, now complex\\nproblems can be solved even by machines which was only\\npossible by humans, decades back. By utilizing these tech-\\nniques in precision medicine, the CDSS could be modiÔ¨Åed to\\nmake complex clinical decisions, recognizing newer phe-\\nnotypes and planning person-oriented specialized treatment\\noptions.\\nIn cardiology, blood tests are popular among the\\ndiÔ¨Äerent investigation methods in precision medicine.\\nAGES is a speciÔ¨Åc precision medicine test which utilizes\\nother factors in addition to blood tests to avoid ischemic\\nheart disease. In precision medicine, concern is mainly\\ngiven towards genetics and there are many research\\nstudies being carried out to Ô¨Ånd genetic causes of a\\ndisease. Cardiac genetics, cardiac oncology, and ischemic\\nheart disease can be identiÔ¨Åed as speciÔ¨Åc areas of interest\\nin precision cardiology. Methods such as blood tests,\\ngenetics tests, image tests, or even a combination of them\\nmay be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes\\nwhen advancing with precision medicine in cardiology.\\nMany cardiovascular diseases have their roots embedded\\nin genetics. Terefore, solutions using precision medicine\\nare considered more productive specially in these types of\\ndiseases. CNN, recurrent neural network (RNN), natural\\nlanguage processing (NLP), SVM, and long short-term\\nmemory (LSTM) are few machine learning techniques\\nwhich could be used eÔ¨Éciently to make precise CDSS\\nusing deep learning [24].\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\n7\\nA machine learning approach to identify cardiologic\\ndiseases includes preprocessing, feature selection, cross\\nvalidation method, machine learning classiÔ¨Åers, and clas-\\nsiÔ¨Åer performance evaluation. Tere are several pre-\\nprocessing techniques such as removing of missing values,\\nstandard scalar, and MinMax scalar. Feature selection is\\nimportant in machine learning as irrelevant features can\\naÔ¨Äect the classiÔ¨Åcation performance of the algorithm. By\\napplying feature selection prior to the classiÔ¨Åcation, the\\nexecution time is reduced and the accuracy of the classiÔ¨Å-\\ncation is increased. Tere are various feature selection al-\\ngorithms. Relief, Minimal Redundancy Maximal Relevance\\n(mRMR), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection\\nOperator (LASSO) are a few popular feature selection al-\\ngorithms [25].\\n3.4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). CKD is a type of a\\nkidney disease which gradually aÔ¨Äects the kidney func-\\ntionality and leads to kidney failure. CDK can be diagnosed\\nusing clinical data, lab tests, imaging studies, and biopsy. But\\nbiopsy has some disadvantages such as being invasive, costly,\\ntime-consuming, and sometimes being risky. Tis is where\\nmachine learning can be applied to overcome the afore-\\nmentioned disadvantages. In many disease predictions using\\nmachine learning, SVM was a commonly used classiÔ¨Åer. But\\nfor CKD, there is not much research that could be found that\\nuses SVM for the classiÔ¨Åcation. ANN, DT, and LR were the\\nmain machine learning classiÔ¨Åers used in this domain. When\\nobserving the obtained results, ANN showed far better\\nperformance when compared with DT and LR on CKD\\ndiagnosis [26].\\n3.5. Parkinson‚Äôs Disease (PD). PD is a chronic and pro-\\ngressive movement disorder. It has no causes, no permanent\\ncure, and limited treatment options. It is found that PD\\noccurs due to reduced production of dopamine, a chemical\\nthat controls movement and coordination. Tremors, rigidity,\\nslowness of movement, and postural instability are a few\\nsymptoms of PD. Abnormal writhing movement is a sig-\\nniÔ¨Åcant symptom of this disease. Some researchers have\\napplied machine learning algorithms on video recordings\\nand computer vision to diÔ¨Äerentiate healthy controls from\\nPD patients. Some researchers have also used voice samples\\nto diÔ¨Äerentiate healthy controls from PD patients [27]. PD\\nbelongs to the neurodegenerative disease category that may\\ndirectly or indirectly aÔ¨Äect the brain cells which will result in\\naÔ¨Äecting movement, speech, and other cognitive parts [28].\\nTe feature set for the classiÔ¨Åcation can be obtained\\nbased on PCA and genetic algorithm (GA). GA is inspired by\\nDarwin‚Äôs theory of evolution. A variable is considered as a\\ngene. Chromosomes are a sequence of a gene. A predeÔ¨Åned\\nfunction evaluates the quality of a chromosome and the\\nhigh-performing chromosome will be used to create the\\noÔ¨Äspring. Genetic operations such as mutation and cross-\\nover are used to create the oÔ¨Äspring. Basically, it is a\\ncompetition between the chromosomes in which the Ô¨Åttest\\nwill survive till the end. Tis is the concept which will be\\nbehind the feature extraction using the GA [29]. PCA is an\\nunsupervised linear conversion technique and a statistical\\ntechnique commonly used to identify new patterns in high-\\ndimensional data. Common applications that use PCA are\\nface recognition and image compression [30].\\n3.6. Dermatological Diseases. Dermatological diseases are\\ncomplex and have a large variety, and people have scarce\\nexpertise on it. Early detection is always preferred as it could\\nlead to serious outcomes. Eczema, herpes, melanoma, and\\npsoriasis are a few dermatological diseases which should be\\nidentiÔ¨Åed at the early stage to take life out of danger.\\nIn one approach that was taken to diagnose dermato-\\nlogical diseases, the Ô¨Årst phase involved data collection and\\ndata augmentation using images. Phase 2 is very important\\nas it is where the model is created and trained. In the last\\nphase, the image is converted to an array and the features are\\nbroken down using the trained model that was created.\\nTere are various augmentation techniques such as synthetic\\nminority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and computer\\nvision techniques like grey scaling, blurring, increasing\\ncontrast, changing the colour channel, sharpening, reducing\\nthe noise, and smoothing. When there are more instances in\\nthe database, it is better for the training of the model.\\nTraining the CNN with a large dataset overcomes the\\noverÔ¨Åtting problem. SVM classiÔ¨Åer is used for the predic-\\ntion. Te features in the Ô¨Ånal convolutional layer can be\\ndirectly given to the SVM as an input. But in order to do this,\\nthe SVM must be trained by giving the trained features from\\nthe Ô¨Ånal convolutional layer as the training dataset. Ten, the\\nSVM will convert it to vectors and store them [31].\\n4. Machine Learning in Medical Imaging\\nMedical imaging is a rapidly growing research area as it is\\nimportant to diagnose diseases in many instances. Several\\nsteps can be identiÔ¨Åed when observing the process of making\\npredictions from an image using machine learning. Once an\\nimage is given as the input, it will be divided into diÔ¨Äerent\\nsegments to zoom the interested area. Ten, with the use of\\ninformation retrieval techniques, features can be extracted\\nfrom those areas. Among them, the required features are\\nselected and the noise is removed. Finally, the classiÔ¨Åer will\\nclassify the extracted data and will make predictions based\\non the classiÔ¨Åcation.\\nNowadays, in the medical community, accurate diag-\\nnosis of a disease by processing large amounts of medical\\ndata is crucial. In the Ô¨Åeld of medicine and biology, there are\\nvarious tasks which are being carried out using machine\\nlearning algorithms. Distribution of data on the basis of their\\ncharacteristics, medical data examination, disease diagnosis\\nand treatment planning, data gathering and inspection,\\ncorrecting diagnostic of diÔ¨Äerent diseases by medical im-\\naging, and extracting features from medical images on\\ndiseases are just a few of the applications.\\nWhen further consideration is given towards the\\napplications of medical imaging, it can be observed that\\nmedical imaging is extensively being used to improve\\nplanning of surgical procedures with regard to many\\n8\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\ndiseases. Terefore, before discussing the involvement of\\nmachine learning in medical imaging, below mentioned\\nare a few such applications that would better explain how\\nmedical imaging is being applied in surgical planning to\\nobtain positive results while mitigating the risks.\\nAs the skull is one of the most complex areas in a human\\nbody in both anatomical and surgical perspectives, surgical\\nmanagement is extremely diÔ¨Écult when working with a wide\\nvariety of lesions. But during the last decades, the endonasal\\nendoscopic route was considered as a suitable approach for\\nseveral skull-based lesions. A main advantage is that when\\nperforming a skull-based surgery through the nose with the\\naid of an endoscope, direct visualization of neurovascular\\nstructures of diÔ¨Äerent areas of the skull base can be obtained\\nwith minimum brain displacement and manipulation. Te\\nendoscope also provides a wider and multiangle close-up\\nview which is of much importance in the surgical Ô¨Åeld [32].\\nFor diseases like rectal cancer, MRI plays a key role as it can\\naccurately depict the local extent of the cancer and generates\\nrelevant information required for prognoses which can\\ndirectly inÔ¨Çuence the choice of the optimal therapeutic\\nprocedure used for each individual patient which encourages\\nthe area of personalized medicine [33].\\nIt is to be noted that when image-guided surgeries are\\ncompared with conventional surgical approaches, image-\\nguided surgeries are less invasive, have more precise tar-\\ngeting, and have improved outcomes. Imaging is used to\\nplan, monitor progress, and to assess results. In neurosur-\\ngery, this is more crucial as the object of the surgical pro-\\ncedure is hard to be located and needs to be reached with\\nminimum damage to the healthy tissues. Apart from it, to\\nguide the placement of the surgical instruments and to\\nensure that the required tissue is being treated, medical\\nimaging is vital. At present, a wide variety of medical im-\\naging modalities are being used such as magnetic resonance\\nimaging,\\ncomputed\\ntomography,\\nultrasound,\\npositron\\nemission tomography, single-photon emission computed\\ntomography, Ô¨Çuoroscopy, and so on to perform diÔ¨Äerent\\nassessments like biopsies, tumour resection, epilepsy, vas-\\ncular conditions, and so on [34]. Medical image analysis is\\nevolving day by day with the development of technology.\\nTis is further assisted by 3D virtual model creation as well\\nto improve understanding of complex anatomy and to\\nprovide powerful tools for surgical planning and intra-\\noperative guidance. Nowadays, the use of 3D ultrasound and\\nfetal MRI is also becoming common in clinical practice [35].\\nTe interesting fact is how machine learning could be in-\\ntegrated with these medical imaging techniques to make\\nbetter decisions in surgical planning. It is to be noted that\\nusing machine learning, it is possible to understand hidden\\nrelationships which may not directly be visible to humans\\nwhen observing multiple data. Tis is the reason that even\\ndisease predictions in healthcare have been made possible\\nthrough machine learning approaches. Terefore, by pro-\\ncessing these medical image data using unsupervised ma-\\nchine learning techniques such as clustering, an analysis\\ncould be performed on the dataset which could later be\\nreferred by the surgeon to identify if any crucial information\\nhas been lost while planning the surgery or else to even\\nconÔ¨Årm that the decisions made on the approach of con-\\nducting the surgery is suitable for the considered patient.\\nEntities such as lesions and organs in medical images are\\ntoo complicated and they cannot be shown correctly with the\\nuse of simple mathematic solutions. Te pixel analysis in\\nmachine learning is used for medical image processing from\\nwhich certain values can be extracted directly from the\\nimage. Feature calculation and segmentation is not required\\nin pixel-based machine learning. Due to this, even an image\\nwith low contrast will have no issue in processing to extract\\ninformation. Pixel analysis utilizes longer training time\\nbecause of the high dimensionality of data. Histogram\\nequalization (HE) is an eÔ¨Écient technique which could be\\nused for contrast improvement. Tere are various other\\nextensions of HE which were implemented in order to\\nimprove the performance of the algorithm. Linear dis-\\ncriminant analysis (LDA), SVM, and DT are few machine\\nlearning methods used to analyse medical images. Low\\nbinary pattern descriptors are being implemented using\\nmachine learning approaches which could be used on bi-\\nological images. Te neural network technique is used in\\nmedical images to investigate the details regarding a disease.\\nMachine learning in medical imaging can also be found in\\nmedical-based expert systems [16].\\nCNN is one of the best models for image analysis. It has\\nseveral layers that could convert the input by using con-\\nvolution Ô¨Ålters. Tere are two sections in classiÔ¨Åcation with\\nregard to medical images. Tey are image classiÔ¨Åcation and\\nobject classiÔ¨Åcation. In image classiÔ¨Åcation, deep learning is\\nused to investigate clinical-related issues so that early\\ntreatment for the patient will be possible. In object classi-\\nÔ¨Åcation, the main target is to analyse more on interested\\nsmall chucks of the medical image. In medical image\\nanalysis, deep learning algorithms help in categorizing,\\nclassifying, and enumerating disease patterns using image\\nprocessing [16].\\nComputers have the ability of performing tasks con-\\nsistently and tirelessly. In the past years, machine learning\\nhas proved its ability to learn and master tasks which were\\nconsidered as too complex for machines to handle, and in\\nsome instances, they have been able to identify patterns\\nwhich are beyond human perception. When using machine\\nlearning on medical images, there are few terms which are\\nwidely used which need to be discussed. ClassiÔ¨Åcation means\\nlabelling or assigning a class to a group of pixels. Model is a\\nset of decision points which are learnt by the machine\\nlearning algorithm. Algorithm is the steps which have been\\ntaken to implement the model. Labelled data are the set of\\ndata which are examples for a speciÔ¨Åc class. Validation set or\\nthe training set is the set of data which is used to train the\\nsystem. Node is a part of a neural network which includes\\ntwo or more inputs and an activation function. A layer is a\\ncombination of nodes from which the outputs are computed.\\nSegmentation is a process of splitting the image into sections\\nso that more focus could be given to the split segments.\\nOverÔ¨Åtting is when a classiÔ¨Åer is too speciÔ¨Åc to the training\\nset and it is not useful as it is only familiar with those ex-\\namples. Having many features can lead to overÔ¨Åtting.\\nFeatures are the numeric values that represent the example.\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\n9\\nWhen it is with regard to medical images, it can be actual\\npixel values, edge strengths, variation in pixel values in a\\nregion, etc. Feature selection must be done in a way that the\\nselected subset of features is able to provide the best and the\\nmost accurate predictions [8].\\nImage recognition and biomedical time series classiÔ¨Å-\\ncation are nonlinear classiÔ¨Åcation problems. With the\\nexisting classiÔ¨Åcation algorithms and feature extraction\\ntechnologies, it is not possible to have highly complicated\\nnonlinear functions. But using DNN, nonlinear functions\\ncan be constructed by increasing the number of layers and\\nneurons in the network. With the use of ensemble learning,\\nmultiple classiÔ¨Åers could also be combined to have com-\\nplicated decision-making functions. Both in SVM and en-\\nsemble learning, nonlinear functions are constructed by\\ncombining multiple kernel functions. In the present context,\\nthe generation strategy is to later use the same learning\\nalgorithm. Terefore, diÔ¨Äerent settings such as learning\\nparameters and training samples are needed. Many methods\\nhave been developed having this idea, and they can be di-\\nvided into four categories. First is to manipulate the training\\nsamples. Bagging, boosting, cross-validated committees,\\nwagging, and arcing sort of approaches are needed for this.\\nTe second way is to manipulate the input features. Methods\\nsuch as random subspace, input decimation, and similarity-\\nbased feature space can be used for this purpose. Te third\\nway is to manipulate the class labels. Output coding and class\\nswitching are examples for this. Te fourth way is inserting\\nrandomness to the learning algorithm. Backpropagation\\nalgorithm, randomized Ô¨Årst-order inductive learner, and RF\\nare few approaches used for this. Te resulting classiÔ¨Åers\\nusing backpropagation will be quite diverse if diÔ¨Äerent initial\\nweights are applied to the same training samples in a neural\\nnetwork. Basically, it is visible that the underlying core of the\\ngeneration strategy is to make the individual classiÔ¨Åers\\ndiÔ¨Äerent so that it could be used to improve the classiÔ¨Åer\\nperformance [36].\\n5. Machine Learning in Biomedicine\\nGene expression datasets contain measurements of in-\\ncreasing and decreasing expression levels of a set of genes.\\nGene expression measurements are usually taken across time\\npoints from tissue samples or patients, and they are rep-\\nresented as a matrix of numerical values. In a protein-\\nprotein interaction network, the nodes represent biomole-\\ncules and the edges represent interactions. In any clustering\\nalgorithm, it is always better to have a minimum number of\\nuser inputs as it is hard for the users to specify correct values.\\nTese user inputs could aÔ¨Äect the accuracy of the algorithm\\nif they are incorrect [15].\\nNowadays, machine learning has become ubiquitous and\\nindispensable when it comes to solving complex problems in\\nmany areas. In biomedicine, machine learning is used for\\nvarious tasks such as to predict protein structure, function\\nfrom genetic sequences, discern optimal diets from patients\\nclinical and microbiome proÔ¨Åle, and so on. Machine\\nlearning is also used in processing real-time, high-resolution\\nphysiological data in various medical applications. Te\\ninvolvement of machine learning in biomedicine can be\\ndiscussed mainly in three approaches. First is that machine\\nlearning improves prognosis. Current prognostic models are\\nrestricted to few variables that humans must enter and tally\\nscores. But these data could be directly taken from EHRs and\\nthen it would allow models to use thousands of rich pre-\\ndictor variables which would increase the accuracy of the\\npredictions. Second is that machine learning will reduce the\\nwork of radiologists and anatomical pathologists. Normally,\\nthese physicians focus on interpreting digitalized images.\\nBut using machine learning algorithms, these images can be\\ngiven as an input, which would result in interpretations and\\npredictions provided by the algorithm. Sometimes, these\\ninterpretations even exceed the accuracy of humans. Apart\\nfrom it, the algorithms do not need rest, and they could work\\ncontinuously at the same accuracy which is not possible for\\nhumans in practice. Tird is that machine learning will\\nimprove the diagnostic accuracy by minimizing the diag-\\nnostic errors. But the challenge which needs to be faced here\\nis the complexity of training the algorithm as the predictions\\nare not binary. Even when working with EHR data, Ô¨Årst the\\ndata need to be preprocessed to be accessible to the algo-\\nrithms as they are often stored in an unstructured format.\\nData themselves are not useful, but they need to be\\nanalysed, interpreted, and acted on to make them useful.\\nAlgorithms are required to perform the aforementioned\\ntasks with datasets. Terefore, new statistical tools from the\\nmachine learning Ô¨Åeld are critical when practicing medicine\\nin the present time. Most of the computer-based algorithms\\nin medicine are expert systems. Tey have a set of rules and\\nknowledge which are being applied to make conclusions\\nwith regard to speciÔ¨Åc clinical scenarios. Tis is an approach\\nthat is similar to a medical student where the general\\nprinciples about medicine are being applied on new patients.\\nBut machine learning is much diÔ¨Äerent than the above\\ndiscussed, as in a machine learning approach, rules are being\\nlearnt from the data themselves. It starts with the patient\\nlevel observations and checks through vast number of\\nvariables to look for combinations that could reliably predict\\nthe outcome. Te highlight in machine learning is the\\nenormous number of predictors that it handles. Sometimes,\\nthere are more predictors than observations and they need to\\nbe combined in a nonlinear and highly interactive way to\\ngenerate accurate outcomes.\\nTruly independent validation datasets must be used from\\ndiÔ¨Äerent populations and periods which have no relation\\nwith the model development when testing the models. If not\\nin the validation stage, the algorithm will have poor per-\\nformance. Machine learning algorithms need high-quality\\ndata in high quantities to reach acceptable performance\\nlevels. If the dataset is biased, it can aÔ¨Äect the performance\\nand the generalizability of the algorithm. Machine learning\\nis not capable of solving any fundamental problems of causal\\ninference in the observational dataset. Even though the\\nalgorithm is good in predicting the outcomes, yet it is to be\\nnoted that these predictors are not the causes [37].\\nMany research studies have given binary interpretations\\non whether a person is being diagnosed with a particular\\ndisease or not. Sometimes, regarding a particular disease, it\\n10\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\nmay show the stage of the disease as well. It could be noticed\\nthat these research studies have been based on a particular\\ndisease, but not many diseases together. To address the said\\nlimitation, a method was proposed called ensemble label\\npower-set pruned dataset joint decomposition (ELPPJD).\\nTe label power-set (LP) method overcomes the indepen-\\ndence problem and takes the correlation among labels into\\nconsideration. But the issues are that the time complexity\\nincreases with the size of the label set and the imbalanced\\nproblem keeps on rising when new label sets are produced.\\nPruned datasets and joint decomposition can be used to\\novercome these issues. In this approach, when creating new\\nclasses, all these training data will be broken down into\\nsubsets which are disjoint. Ten, using a similarity threshold,\\nthe labels which are more similar to each other will be\\ngrouped. Te subset partition strategies can be size balanced\\n(SB) and label similarity (LS). Random K-label sets (RAKEL)\\nand hierarchy of multilabel classiÔ¨Åers (HOMER) are mul-\\ntilabel classifying methods which can be used as alternatives\\nfor this approach. RAKEL runs based on MEKA, and C4.5 is\\nthe basic classiÔ¨Åcation algorithm. HOMER runs based on\\nMULAN, and RF is the basic classiÔ¨Åcation algorithm.\\nRAKEL shows better performance than HOMER. But\\nELPPJD with LS partition strategy outperforms both RAKEL\\nand HOMER [38].\\n6. Machine Learning in Biomedical\\nEvent Extraction\\nTe relationship between the disease and the drug, the re-\\nlationship between the disease and the gene, the interaction\\nbetween drugs, and the interaction between proteins are\\nbiological events which have complex structures. To extract\\nthese biomedical events accurately and eÔ¨Éciently, bio-\\nmedical text mining technology is important as the amount\\nof unstructured and semistructured biomedical literature\\ndata is rapidly growing.\\nPattern-based methods are used in biomedical relation\\nextraction. But they are not much used in biomedical event\\nextraction. Event extraction systems are mainly divided into\\ntwo types which are rule-based event extraction systems and\\nmachine learning-based event extraction systems. In the\\nmachine learning approach, the task of extracting bio-\\nmedical events is considered as a classiÔ¨Åcation problem. Te\\nhighly unbalanced training dataset given in biomedical event\\nextraction is an issue, and most of the systems do not address\\nthis problem. But SVM addresses this issue using the simple\\nclass weighting strategy. Machine learning-based event ex-\\ntraction systems have three types. First type is the pipeline\\nmodel. Te pipeline model has achieved excellent results in\\nthe event extraction task. But the drawbacks in it are that the\\ntime complexity is high and each step is based on the\\nprevious step. Terefore, if there is an error, that error would\\nbe carried till the Ô¨Ånal step. Second type is the joint model.\\nTis model overcame the previous drawbacks discussed, yet\\nit involves complicated calculations. Tird type is the\\npairwise model. Tis is a combination of both pipeline and\\njoint models. Pairwise model is faster than the joint model\\nand more accurate than the pipeline model. Tis model uses\\nSVM to overcome the multiclass and multilabel classiÔ¨Åca-\\ntion problem without dealing with data imbalance.\\nA system proposed to extract biomedical events from\\nimbalanced data has several steps. First, text preprocessing\\nwill be carried out using token features, sentence features,\\nsentence dependency features, and external resource fea-\\ntures. Next is the sample selection, based on sequential\\npatterns. It aims to Ô¨Ånd the frequent subsequence or se-\\nquential events that satisfy the minimum support. Tis\\nincludes the extraction of sequential patterns in the text.\\nTen, the detection of multiargument events is performed,\\nfollowed by the joint scoring mechanism. Tis will result in\\nobtaining the outcome. Te tool sentence2vec, based on\\nconvolutional deep structured semantic models (C-DSSMs),\\nis used to calculate the semantic relevance score [39].\\nUsing SVM, it is possible to separate event extraction\\ninto multiple classiÔ¨Åcation tasks, individually detecting the\\ntrigger words deÔ¨Åning events and the arguments that de-\\nscribe which proteins or genes take part in these events. Tis\\nis based on labelled data and supervised learning algorithms.\\nBut the issue is that these systems get aÔ¨Äected by data\\nsparseness. Especially, it happens when the training dataset\\nis too small to Ô¨Ånd enough information to assign proper\\nweights to those low-frequency or out-of-vocabulary fea-\\ntures. Terefore, research was carried out to implement\\nsystems that would use the semisupervised or the unsu-\\npervised machine learning approach to extract biomedical\\nevents. In PubMed, a large pool of unlabelled data with\\npotential information with regard to the biomedical event\\nextraction domain can be found to go ahead with the re-\\nsearch. Te basic features are obtained by the labelled data\\nand the information which is lacking in labelled data can be\\nobtained from unlabelled data using the event feature\\ncoupling generalization strategy. Sparse features that were\\nÔ¨Åltered by supervised machine learning methods can be used\\nto increase the performance of the system while these could\\neven be considered when using a semisupervised machine\\nlearning approach for biomedical event extraction [40].\\nProteins are the end products of a gene expression.\\nUnderstanding the gene function at the proteome level is a\\nsigniÔ¨Åcant interest in the biological and medical research\\ncommunity. Tere are large repositories of protein data\\nwhose characteristics are unknown as noting their func-\\ntional features using experimental methods have lagged far\\nbehind. Tis creates a need of a computational method to\\naddress the issue by accurately working on the large datasets\\neven with a limited amount of labelled data. Functional,\\nstructural, and evolutionary characteristics of the protein\\ncan be extracted by using the protein sequence information.\\nTe aim of protein classiÔ¨Åcation is to extract this infor-\\nmation accurately, and it has only been possible with the\\napplication of machine learning algorithms to analyse the\\nprotein data repositories [41].\\n7. Machine Learning\\nApproaches to Polypharmacology\\nPolypharmacology focuses on designing medical treatment\\nthat can target multiple receptors. Te eÔ¨Écacy and toxicity of\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\n11\\ndrugs result from complex interactions between pharma-\\ncodynamic, pharmacokinetic, genetic, epigenetic, and en-\\nvironmental factors even though it may be designed as a\\nsingle or multitarget treatment. Machine learning-related\\ncomputational techniques are required to enable the pre-\\ndiction and analysis of in vitro and in vivo drug-response\\nphenotypes.\\nIdentiÔ¨Åcation of drug-target interaction on a proteome-\\nwide scale is essential to deÔ¨Åne and predict a drug response.\\nApart from its genetic and epigenetic variations, cell-to-cell\\ncommunication, cell-to-cell variability, and other environ-\\nmental factors must also be considered. System-based ap-\\nproaches help in drug discovery as they could identify\\ncellular connectivity between all the aforementioned com-\\nponents. New computational methods are needed to ac-\\ncurately calculate free-energy landscapes during association\\nand dissociation of protein-ligand complexes. It will allow to\\ninvestigate quantitatively both low and high aÔ¨Énity binding\\non a proteome-wide scale. Self-organizing map is an un-\\nsupervised machine learning technique that is used to cluster\\ndrug molecules. Prediction of drug-target interactions can\\nbe done by combining the sequence features of the receptor\\nwith the Ô¨Ångerprint of the ligand, in order to train modules\\nbased on statistical machine learning. Tere are four com-\\nputational areas which are crucial in polypharmacology, and\\nthey are the proteome-wide prediction of drug-target in-\\nteractions, the quantitative modelling of protein-ligand\\ninteractions, the integrated analysis of biological networks,\\nand the dynamic and stoichiometric simulation of biological\\nnetworks [42].\\nNGS includes both DNA and RNA sequencing. It in-\\nvolves the task of braking DNA and RNA into fragments and\\ndetermining the order of the nucleotide bases in each\\nfragment. DNA sequencing can either be whole genome\\nsequencing (WGS) or whole exome sequencing (WES) of the\\ncoding regions of all known genes and targeted sequencing\\nof genomic regions or genes implicated in a disease. WGS\\nand WES can be found in clinical practices to evaluate\\ndevelopmental brain disorders such as autism, seizures, and\\nintellectual disability. Tere are commercially available se-\\nquencing platforms which use various methods to generate\\nsequence data. With the continuous modiÔ¨Åcations resulted\\nfrom the advancement of technologies, NGS-based plat-\\nforms have shown a comparatively low error rate. In NGS\\ntechnologies, Sanger sequencing is considered to be the most\\naccurate sequencing method and it is often used for the\\nvalidation of genetic variants due to its high accuracy [43].\\nWhen modern machine learning is combined with\\nmedical practice by using clinical data sources, various\\nprediction models could be generated for similar clinical\\nquestions. From early warning systems till superhuman\\nimaging diagnostics, there are many applications of machine\\nlearning in medical practice. Machine learning methods\\nprovide predictions based on existing data. Te Google Ô¨Çu\\nreminds how forecasting an annual event based on 1 year of\\ndata could lead to time series problems. Having loads of data\\nover the past time has diminishing returns. Basically, it is\\nfound in research on decision support algorithms that it is\\nbetter to use the most recent year data instead of historical\\ndata of multiple years for better accurate decisions. Even\\nwhen evaluating prediction models, the main idea behind\\nthis is not about the ability to do repetitions of historical\\ntrends but the accuracy it has on predicting future trends. It\\nis true that machine learning algorithms can improve the\\nprediction accuracy by using conventional regression\\nmodels by capturing complex and nonlinear relationships in\\nthe data. But it is to be noted that even though highest\\ncomputing power is provided, there is no possibility of\\ngetting information that is not present. Terefore, using\\nclinical data alone has limited the prediction power. By\\nincorporating the correct data streams, the level of pre-\\ndiction accuracy can be improved. But not even a simple\\nnonlinear system can precisely predict the distant future.\\nTiny variations which seem nothing and very less important\\nrounding errors can accumulate and make a massive impact\\non future events [44].\\n8. Machine Learning for Drug Repurposing\\nUsing System Biology\\nMore than 90% of the drugs that go through the early phases\\nof clinical trials fail due to reasons such as adverse reactions,\\nside eÔ¨Äects, or lack of eÔ¨Éciency. To overcome these chal-\\nlenges, drug repurposing has been considered. Repurposing\\ndrugs can be either drug-based or disease-based. Drugs that\\nare strongly anticorrelated with a disease are likely to be\\ncandidates for repurposing. Te connectivity map was the\\nÔ¨Årst project that aimed to explore the functional connectivity\\nbetween drugs. It even considered the functional connec-\\ntivity between drugs and diseases. Systems biology can be\\nused to discover and develop drugs by giving concern to the\\ninteractions of the components in biological entities. Drugs\\nare being ranked based on the amount of perturbation they\\ncause on speciÔ¨Åc disease-related genes.\\nA drug disease network (DDN) is constructed by inte-\\ngrating the knowledge on disease-related genes, drug targets,\\nsignalling pathways, and gene-gene interactions. Te DDN\\nrepresents all the interactions between drug targets and\\ngenes, related to a given disease as described in Kyoto\\nEncyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signalling\\npathways. Te repurposing scores of the drug-disease pairs\\nare calculated using the Pearson correlation coeÔ¨Écient be-\\ntween their gene perturbation signatures, and it can take a\\nvalue between 1 to ‚àí1. A high positive value indicates that\\nthe drug and the disease both cause similar perturbations to\\nthe system, and a high negative value indicates that the drug\\nand the disease have opposite gene perturbation signatures.\\nBy using this value, it can be recognized whether it is a drug\\nthat could be considered as a treatment to a given disease\\n[45].\\nTerefore, it is clear that when a patient approaches and\\nexpects support from healthcare, the decision making starts\\nin the process of the patient being diagnosed with a disease\\nand it continues till the proper treatment or medication is\\nprescribed for the patient. In this process, which is a chain of\\ndecisions, to support each decision, machine learning ap-\\nproaches are involved in healthcare. Tasks such as predicting\\nor diagnosing a disease, identifying hidden diseases,\\n12\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\nproviding clinical decision support, and even recognizing\\nwhether a drug is suitable as a treatment to the given disease\\nare being conducted using machine learning approaches to\\nsupport clinicians to make fast and accurate decisions.\\nStepping further ahead, even after a patient is cured from a\\ndisease, using machine learning approaches, the EHRs of\\npatients are processed and analysed to identify any future\\nhealth risks that could possibly occur.\\n9. Discussion\\nIn this section, the main concern would be given towards\\nhighlighting important and crucial facts of the topics dis-\\ncussed throughout the paper. To start with, it is better to give\\nconcern towards the performance of machine learning al-\\ngorithms. To identify best performing algorithms, classiÔ¨Åer\\naccuracy and the classiÔ¨Åer log loss are two factors that can be\\nconsidered. Te classiÔ¨Åer accuracy needs to be high and the\\nclassiÔ¨Åer log loss needs to be low for an algorithm to be\\nidentiÔ¨Åed as a well-performing algorithm. Terefore, once\\nselecting a suitable algorithm to address a speciÔ¨Åc concern,\\nthe aforementioned factors are considered to select the al-\\ngorithm out of many diÔ¨Äerent existing algorithms that\\nwould best suit our purpose.\\nIn most clustering algorithms, the eÔ¨Äectiveness of the\\nalgorithm depends on the appropriate parameters that the\\nuser inputs. For example, parameters like number of ex-\\npected clusters, a starting point in the dataset, minimum\\nnumber of samples to form a cluster, and so on aÔ¨Äect the\\nclustering result. Tis is a serious issue when biological and\\nbiomedical data are considered as they are nonspherical and\\nhigh-dimensional. Automatic density clustering method\\nwith multiple kernels (ADCMK) is a proposed option to\\nanswer the said issue. Using that method, clusters with\\narbitrary shape can be easily identiÔ¨Åed based on their\\ndensity. When comparing the conventional clustering al-\\ngorithms, ADCMK automatically determines optimal values\\nfor the cutoÔ¨Ädistance, kernel weights, and number of\\nclusters and centroids which will not change the clustering\\nresult when executed time to time. It also has comparatively\\nbetter accuracy. Multiple kernel clustering approaches help\\nin optimally combining the learning algorithms in order to\\nobtain excellent clustering results and performance in\\nvarious scenarios. Tey are mostly suitable to handle labelled\\ndatasets as they are a part of supervised kernel learning.\\nTere is also an unsupervised multiple kernel learning ap-\\nproach that aims to determine the linear combination of\\nmultiple kernels based on an unlabelled dataset [46].\\nIt is not possible to exactly highlight which algorithm is\\nbetter than the other. Te reason is that it depends on the\\ndomain that the training and the tests are being executed, the\\ndataset that is involved in the training and testing proce-\\ndures, the level of preprocessing that is being performed on\\nthe dataset, the selected feature set for the algorithm or the\\nfeature selection algorithms that have been used on the\\ndataset, the size of the dataset and the data types in the\\ndataset, the performance level and the capacity of the ma-\\nchine, and much more. Tis makes it vital to select the\\nproper algorithm that would be ideal for the requirement.\\nNormally, this cannot be directly selected, but it will be an\\niterative process to select the most suitable algorithm from a\\nÔ¨Åltered set of algorithms which would best Ô¨Åt the problem in\\nhand. Te proper knowledge and past experiences gathered\\nwill help in constructing the Ô¨Åltered set of algorithms. When\\nlooking at a simple example from the biomedical Ô¨Åeld, it can\\nbe seen that for the diagnosis of various diseases, the best\\nperforming algorithm changes due to the aforementioned\\nreason. Tis could be further explained by looking at the\\nscenarios below, in detail.\\nMany studies have been carried out using ANN, DT,\\nand LR to diagnose kidney diseases, and ANN has out-\\nperformed both DT and LR by a huge margin [26].\\nAccording to previous studies, it is to be noted that the\\naccuracy of the results obtained with regard to lung\\ncancer diagnosis is in the order of SVM, ANN, and DT.\\nApart from them, various other techniques also have been\\nused and they have also showed a reasonable level of\\naccuracy. Tese algorithms are GA, BPNN, HopÔ¨Åeld\\nneural network, and LDA [30]. Another beneÔ¨Åt that could\\nbe gained by using SVM classiÔ¨Åcation is that through\\nSVM, it is possible to calculate even the stage of the lung\\ncancer [18]. Regression can be used to model and predict\\nthe association between the dependent variable and the\\nindependent variable. Regression can be categorized as\\nlinear regression and logistic regression. For linear re-\\ngression, the dependent variable should be continuous,\\nand for logistic regression, the dependent variable should\\nbe discrete. Using the logistic regression algorithm to\\npredict complex disease such as cancer must be avoided.\\nKNN is not suitable for cancer predictions as the datasets\\nare huge and more complex which could make the\\nclustering process more diÔ¨Écult [47]. It was found that\\nDNN has better performance for breast cancer detection.\\nTen ANN, SVM, and KNN were ranked in the given\\norder with regard to their performance [48]. It is to be\\nnoted that DNN has also shown higher accuracy in\\npredicting diabetics compared with the other standard\\nmachine learning algorithms. When discussing extract-\\ning of medical data from documents, datasets, databases,\\nmedical images, etc. for analysing purposes, various CNN\\nalgorithms can be used to extract features from un-\\nstructured data. For structured data, NB, KNN, and DT\\nalgorithms can be used. For textual data which are un-\\nstructured, CNN-based unimodal disease risk prediction\\n(CNN-UDRP) can be used. For both structured and\\nunstructured data, CNN-based multimodal disease risk\\nprediction (CNN-MDRP) can be used. In the CNN-\\nUDRP algorithm, tests are represented in the form of a\\nvector. For each word, the distributed representation of\\nthe word embedding found in NLP is used. When\\nworking with CNN, it is required to specify the number of\\nwords for the sliding window. When assigning a value for\\nthe sliding window, it is important to assign a value that\\nwould help in reaching the highest accuracy when it is\\nbeing used [8]. When giving concern to these aspects,\\nwhat could be seen is how these machine learning ap-\\nproaches assist in healthcare decision making of the\\nclinicians. When analysing reports and when going\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\n13\\nthrough the patients‚Äô medical history, these algorithms\\nare used to highlight the factors that deÔ¨Ånitely need to be\\nconsidered by the clinician when prescribing treatment.\\nIn addition to it, these algorithms are also used to assist in\\nidentifying the level that the disease has spread in the\\npatient so that the treatment can be given accordingly\\nbased on the disease severity.\\nMoving on to the next topic, which is medical imaging, it\\nis visible that currently, medical image classiÔ¨Åcation is\\nmostly based on pattern recognition methods. It has been\\nfound that classiÔ¨Åcation-based neural networks have better\\nperformance than other supervised machine learning al-\\ngorithms. Deep learning is considered as a combination of\\nboth supervised and unsupervised methods. Te reason is\\nthat it initially relies on unsupervised learning for training\\nthe DNN and then to Ô¨Åne tune the neural network, it uses\\nsupervised learning. When compared with various classiÔ¨Å-\\ncation algorithms, CNN combined with adaptive sliding\\nwindow fusion mechanism has good stability and robustness\\nalong with high classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy. Even when it is for\\nbreast tumour or brain tumour diagnosis, the aforemen-\\ntioned approach with CNN has given comparatively better\\nresults [49]. As both deep learning and ensemble learning\\ncan construct complicated nonlinear functions, by com-\\nbining them, it is possible to handle more complex tasks.\\nBiomedical time series often has interfering noise. But when\\ntrying to eliminate the noise, along with it some useful\\ninformation might also be lost. DNN has the ability to\\ncapture useful information while ignoring the interfering\\nnoise after learning from training samples. Presently, DNN\\nmainly includes CNN, deep belief network (DBN), and\\nautoencoder (AE). CNN performs convolution operations\\non both horizontal and vertical directions. Tis is a good\\napproach for image data as it is relevant in both directions.\\nBut for biomedical time series with multiple channels, this is\\nnot suitable as only horizontal direction is relevant and the\\nvertical direction is independent. For this reason, multi-\\nchannel CNN can also be implemented to obtain better\\nclassiÔ¨Åcation performance [36].\\nWhen further observed, it is also visible that in the\\npresent context, medical imaging has also been combined\\nwith the 3D printing technology to achieve greater success\\nspecially when surgical planning is to be considered. 3D\\nprinting can turn a 3D medical image dataset into a 3D\\nobject as per the patient‚Äôs actual size. Tis can largely im-\\nprove the precision of modern surgical planning by com-\\nbining with other preoperative plan and intraoperative\\nnavigation techniques. By combining these with the cloud\\ncomputing architecture, there is further space for im-\\nprovement in cost eÔ¨Éciency, Ô¨Çexibility, and clinical work-\\nÔ¨Çow. Terefore, further exploration needs to be done on 3D\\nprinting and cloud computing technologies of their usage in\\nthe surgical realm. Nowadays, surgeons are able to perform\\nrisky procedures with high level of safety and accuracy with\\nthe development of multimodality imaging, with regard to\\nespecially the fusion of functional imaging in preoperative\\nplanning and modern image guided therapy in intra-\\noperative navigation. With the development of medical\\nimaging technology, there are multiple imaging processing\\nsystems and intraoperative imaging guided platforms which\\nare being introduced that are powerful but also complicated\\n[50]. In addition to it, 3D printing has also been used to\\ndesign advanced prosthetic devices with the aim of devel-\\noping a realistic model which is closely similar to the actual\\npart with regard to the geometry and mechanical properties.\\nWhen making such products, even though the geometry can\\nbe easily obtained by the 3D scanned data, the mechanical\\nproperties need to be mechanically validated and a major\\nconcern should be given towards composite material\\ntechnology [51]. A few of the currently existing Ô¨Åndings on\\nprosthetic devices are brieÔ¨Çy discussed below.\\nTe concept of creating a soft total artiÔ¨Åcial heart from\\nsilicon elastomers using the lost-wax casting technique has\\nalso been possible as the 3D printing technology has enabled\\nthe production of entirely soft pumps with complex chamber\\ngeometries. Even though it is not yet readily implantable, it\\npromotes the future of personalized medicine and artiÔ¨Åcial\\nheart development without requiring expensive and com-\\nplex equipment [52]. By using an array of semiconductor\\nphoto detectors which are made of polymers and printed on\\na glass hemisphere, a 3D printed prototype of a bionic eye\\nhas been designed and further research is being carried out\\non ways to improve the eÔ¨Éciency of the photo detectors and\\nto Ô¨Ånd a way to print on a soft hemispherical material that\\ncould be implanted to a real human eye [53]. Researchers\\nhave also developed a 3D printed tooth that also kills bacteria\\nusing conventional artiÔ¨Åcial tooth resins combined with\\npositively charged quaternary ammonium ions [54]. In\\nanother study, a handheld portable printer was developed\\nwhich could be used to create narrow sheets of skin tissue\\nmade from collagen and Ô¨Åbrin to cover and heal deep\\nwounds. Tis printer can tailor tissues based on the patient\\nand the wound characteristics within two minutes or less.\\nFurther research is being carried out on ways to expand the\\nsize of the printed strips so that larger wounds could be\\ncovered [55]. Bioengineers have 3D printed artiÔ¨Åcial\\nhyperelastic bones which could quickly induce bone re-\\ngeneration and growth. Currently, it has been implanted\\nsuccessfully in animal models and a main advantage in this\\napproach is that the 3D printing process can customize any\\nshape of a bone as per the requirement and can create it\\nwithin a day. It is to be noted that the materials used to create\\nthese 3D printed bones are Ô¨Çexible, and after combining\\nthem with the bone structure, with time, they bond with the\\nexisting bones and become a part of the human body [56]. A\\ngroup of scientists has 3D printed a bionic ear with an\\nantenna and a cartilage that can hear the radio frequencies\\neven beyond the range of a normal human‚Äôs capability. It has\\nalso been created in such a way that the electrical signals\\nproduced from the ear can be connected with the nerve\\nendings which is considered to be the Ô¨Årst time that 3D\\nprinting was eÔ¨Äectively used to interweave tissues with\\nelectronics [57]. Tere are many such prosthetic devices\\nwhich were outcomes of previous research studies that were\\ncarried out, and further research is being conducted on them\\npresently to improve the existing results. Medical imaging,\\n3D printing technologies, and various other computational\\napproaches have been vital when conducting these research\\n14\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\nstudies to obtain improved results. When giving concern to\\nhow machine learning could be involved in these Ô¨Åndings, it\\nis visible that machine learning approaches could analyse\\nlarge biological and material datasets to identify various\\nrelationships which exist between the data. In addition to it,\\nas machine learning is used to detect diseases and the se-\\nverity level of it, these machine learning algorithms can be\\ncombined with the equipment that is being used to design\\nsuch prosthetic devices so that when the medical dataset is\\ngiven, an analysis is to be performed so that the devices can\\nbe customized and designed based on the patient‚Äôs re-\\nquirement which would further encourage the latest trend in\\nhealthcare, which is personalized medicine.\\nWhen discussing biomedicine, biomedical data play an\\nimportant role which cannot be neglected. It is vital to\\nextract the required knowledge from biomedical data that\\nwould make paths visible to explore the subject matters\\nfurther. When giving concern towards bioinformatics and\\nbiomedical data, there are various documents that contain\\nhigh-dimensional data with large number of attributes such\\nas categorical images and text records. To extract infor-\\nmation from such documents eÔ¨Éciently and with high ac-\\ncuracy,\\nt-distributed\\nstochastic\\nneighbour\\nembedding\\nmethod could be used. It is a popular method for exploring\\nhigh-dimensional data in the Ô¨Åeld of machine learning and\\ncan be incorporated with the multiple kernel approach as\\nwell. ADCMK performs data preprocessing, optimal com-\\nbined kernel determination, cluster centroid detection, and\\nassignment and visualization of clusters which shows ex-\\ncellent results when working with larger-scale biological and\\nbiomedical datasets without class label information [46].\\nUnder biomedical event extraction, the challenges that\\nprotein classiÔ¨Åcation tasks need to face due to the limited\\ndata that are available for learning and the unbalanced\\nclasses in those existing data need to be considered and\\naddressed. Expectation-maximization-based algorithms are\\nthere to address these challenges by incorporating unlabelled\\ndata. Even by using the n-gram model for the feature space\\nwith the NB classiÔ¨Åer, the accuracy of the model could be\\nimproved to some extent without using unlabelled data. Te\\ntransductive support vector machine (TSVM) method is a\\nsemisupervised learning approach that also could be used in\\naddressing the said issues. But there are other semi-\\nsupervised algorithms as well that could perform better in\\ncertain classiÔ¨Åcation problems [41].\\nWhile coming towards the machine learning ap-\\nproaches to polypharmacology, it is important to rec-\\nognize about certain risks or loopholes which can be\\nfound when integrating machine learning algorithms\\nwith biology and biomedicine. In some occasions, there\\nmay be identical twins with the same observable demo-\\ngraphic characteristics, lifestyle, medical care, and ge-\\nnetics which will provide same predictions by a machine\\nlearning algorithm but will end up in totally unexpected\\ndiÔ¨Äerent outcomes. Tis is an instance to show that the\\nincorporation of machine learning with biology and\\nbiomedicine should be performed with maximum care\\nand monitoring. Research studies are growing in number\\ntrying to increase the accuracy of the predictions made,\\nbut still these algorithms do not state how to change the\\nobtained outcome. It even does not assure whether it is\\npossible to change the received outcomes in any possible\\nway. Machine learning-based identiÔ¨Åcations are strong,\\nbut they are theory free. Tis means that no theory-based\\nexplanations can be provided, even for the generated\\npredictions. Sometimes, the most accurate predictions\\nmade by machine learning algorithms are obvious to the\\npracticing clinicians as well. Even though predictive al-\\ngorithms cannot eliminate medical uncertainty, they\\nimprove allocation of scarce healthcare resources. Using\\nDNN, now early warning systems can be rapidly devel-\\noped and optimized using real-world data. Tese systems\\nwill also have capabilities which seemed to be impossible\\nto be achieved previously [44].\\nHere onwards the discussion will give concern towards\\nincreasing the productivity of applications through in-\\ncreasing the performance of the machine learning algo-\\nrithms. In order to increase the performance and the\\neÔ¨Éciency of machine learning algorithms, various steps and\\nmeasures are being carried out and tested by the researchers.\\nWhen observing the said fact, next are a few instances to get\\nan idea of what sort of tasks are being conducted to increase\\nthe performance of the algorithms. When considering the\\naccuracy, sensitivity, and the speciÔ¨Åcity of classiÔ¨Åers while\\nchanging the number of folds, any major Ô¨Çuctuation was not\\nfound in the values obtained in the confusion matrix. All\\nwere just small variations in the Ô¨Ånal decimal places which\\ncan be ignored [26]. But DNN, feature selection methods,\\nand cross validation techniques can be applied to increase\\nthe classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy [10, 58]. It is also to be noted that\\npositive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value\\n(NPV), accuracy, sensitivity, and speciÔ¨Åcity attributes show\\nan improvement when a classiÔ¨Åer is applied after performing\\nPCA rather than the classiÔ¨Åer being applied to the oÔ¨Écial\\nfeature set (OFS). But when the GA was used instead of the\\nPCA, all the above attributes showed a further improvement\\neven than what was resulted after the PCA has been applied\\n[29].\\nEnsemble learner is constructed by a collection of\\nindividual classiÔ¨Åers. When there is a pattern classiÔ¨Å-\\ncation problem, it is solved by a combination of multiple\\nclassiÔ¨Åer outputs. Majority voting, bagging, and boosting\\nare few well-known ensemble methods which can be used\\nto combine the outputs. Normally, this approach is more\\naccurate than using a single classiÔ¨Åer. In the majority\\nvoting method, the label to be assigned is decided based\\non the majority of the individual classiÔ¨Åer‚Äôs outputs. Te\\nbagging method decreases the variance of the predictions\\nby generating additional data for training from the\\noriginal dataset. Te boosting method has two steps. Te\\nÔ¨Årst is using the original data to produce a series of\\naveragely performing models. Ten, the next step is to\\nincrease the performance by combining the previous\\nperformances using a voting scheme [10]. Using the\\nensemble technique, a weak classiÔ¨Åer can be converted to\\na strong classiÔ¨Åer. When working with a weak classiÔ¨Åer, it\\nis merged using the weighted average of the prediction\\naccuracy as metrics. Ten, the error will be propagated\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\n15\\nwith every prediction, and until the prediction becomes\\naccurate, multiple iterations will be carried out to reduce\\nthe error [59].\\nMaximum sensitivity neural networks use the back-\\npropagation algorithm to adjust the weights associated\\nwith the neurons. Tis is special as it saves time and\\nmemory while predicting more accurately as the output\\nlayer detects the maximum sensitivity of the neurons for\\nthe new pattern [47].\\nMachine learning feature extraction is the process that\\nhelps in identifying the relevant attributes from various\\ncandidate subnets, and it plays a vital role in creating an\\neÔ¨Äective predictive model. Tere are various beneÔ¨Åts of\\napplying feature selection, such as highly eÔ¨Äective and fast\\ntraining of the machine learning algorithm, reducing the\\ncomplexity of the model, improving the accuracy of the\\nmodel, and eliminating the overÔ¨Åtting problem. Tere are\\nthree groups that could be identiÔ¨Åed in feature selection\\nmethods. Tey are Ô¨Ålter, wrapper, and embedded methods.\\nTe Ô¨Ålter method is normally a preprocessing step that relies\\non general features. Te wrapper method uses machine\\nlearning in order to select the best and the most suited subset\\nof features. Forward feature selection, backward feature\\nelimination, and recursive feature elimination are widely\\nused wrapper methods. Te embedded method combines\\nthe qualities of the Ô¨Ålter and wrapper methods [17]. It is\\nimportant to remember that when features are correlated to\\nother features, there is no point having all of them con-\\nsidered in the machine learning algorithm as it will increase\\nonly the execution time but will not improve the eÔ¨Éciency of\\nthe algorithm. It is also to be noted that when adding certain\\nfeatures, the accuracy of the algorithm may drop. It is\\npreferred if each of the features could be tested individually\\nand then combined in a way that the accuracy of the output\\nwill be increased [27]. Te quality of the feature selection\\nprocess has a direct impact on the accuracy increase. Some\\nalgorithms like ANN show a higher increase in the accuracy\\nwhen compared with other algorithms after the feature\\nselection phase is performed [25].\\nMachine learning techniques have gained signiÔ¨Åcantly\\nhigh accuracy when considering classiÔ¨Åcation-based prob-\\nlems. A four-tier architecture can be used to store and\\nprocess a huge volume of data eÔ¨Éciently. Tier 1 can be used\\nto collect data, and tier 2 can be used to store huge volumes\\nof data. Tier 3 and tier 4 can be used for machine learning\\nclassiÔ¨Åcations and representation of the results, respectively\\n[14]. In the present time, as computing power is not an issue,\\nDNN has more than 20 layers. Early neural networks were\\ntypically less than 5 layers. DNNs are used for various\\npurposes such as automatic object detection, segmentation\\non images, automatic speech recognition, genotypic and\\nphenotypic detection, classiÔ¨Åcation of diseases in bio-\\ninformatics, and so on. Even though CNN is quite similar to\\nregular neural networks, it assumes that there are geometric\\nrelationships among inputs. By using convolutional layers in\\nDNN, important features could be ampliÔ¨Åed for better\\nanalysis. Te pooling layer in CNN takes the output and\\nÔ¨Ånds the maximal value so that it could give the convolution\\nfunction the best extracts of the images. Regularization is\\nused when training deep networks as it increases the per-\\nformance by reducing overÔ¨Åtting. Tere are no exact number\\nof layers to obtain more accurate results, but it is an iterative\\ntrial and error process in which the best architecture needs to\\nbe found for a speciÔ¨Åc problem. Te advantage of using CNN\\nover traditional machine learning algorithms is that there is\\nno need to compute the features as the Ô¨Årst step. But CNN\\nwill Ô¨Ånd the important features as a part of its searching\\nprocess [8].\\nAs ANN is complex, other simple machine learning\\nalgorithms such as SVM, KNN, and RF gradually came\\nahead of ANN in popularity. By selecting the appropriate\\nactivation functions, better feature extraction can be\\nachieved, as they are what form the nonlinear layers in deep\\nlearning frameworks. Tere are many activation functions.\\nSigmoid function, hyperbolic tangent, softmax, rectiÔ¨Åed\\nlinear unit (ReLU), softplus, absolute value rectiÔ¨Åcation, and\\nmaxout are a few of such commonly used activation\\nfunctions. Tere are various deep learning architectures such\\nas AE, DBN, restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM), CNN,\\nand RNN. AE is diÔ¨Äerent from ordinary ANN as it extracts\\nfeatures from unlabelled data and sets target values to be\\nequal to the inputs. RBMs are generative graphical models\\nand their aim is to learn the distribution of the training data.\\nDBM can be considered as a stack of AEs or RBMs. CNN is\\ndiÔ¨Äerent from other deep learning algorithms as it extracts\\nfeatures from small sections of an input image. RNN out-\\nperforms all the other deep learning approaches when it is\\nabout dealing with sequential data. Machine learning is\\nwidely used in the medical image domain. Sparse autoen-\\ncoder (SAE) and RBM can deal with dynamic data and they\\ncan also extract patterns from unlabelled data. Due to its\\ncapacity of analysing special data, CNN is used in biomedical\\nimage analysis commonly. When considering the challenges,\\nit is to note that in deep learning, it requires a large amount\\nof labelled data for model training. Another issue when\\nworking with biomedical data is that they are imbalanced, as\\nthe normal people set is much larger than the diagnosed\\npeople set. Tey also need high memory and high computing\\npower. Te input images must be in high resolution.\\nNowadays, there are various medical devices and sensors\\nwhich provide large amounts of data. Deep learning ap-\\nproaches are good interpreters of these data for disease\\nprediction, prevention, and diagnosis. Table 1 lists few ap-\\nplications of the above-discussed deep learning algorithms\\nin the Ô¨Åeld of biology and biomedicine [60].\\nAs per Table 2, there are several open-source machine\\nlearning libraries in various languages which could be used\\nto assist in the development process when implementing\\nintelligent biological applications. Python and C++ have the\\nmost number of libraries that support deep learning. But\\nPython is more often used in traditional machine learning\\napproaches [60]. Te popularity or the usage of various deep\\nlearning frameworks in projects, when categorized based on\\nthe language that they are written in, is shown in Figure 1.\\nAt the initial stage, simple machine learning classifying\\nand clustering algorithms were used in data processing and\\npredictions, but when moving forward, with the develop-\\nment\\nin\\ncomputational\\npower\\nand\\nprogramming\\n16\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\nmethodologies, more enhanced and complex machine\\nlearning algorithms were adapted by the Ô¨Åeld of biology and\\nbiomedicine to obtain more accurate results at a higher\\neÔ¨Éciency. Even at this very moment various attempts are\\nbeing executed to further evolve the computational biology\\nand biomedicine domain with the integration of sophisti-\\ncated scalable machine learning algorithms. Many languages\\nprovide multiple application program interfaces (APIs) and\\nlibraries in order to assist in these development processes so\\nthat the main concern or priority could be given to the\\nrequirement with regard to the subject matter and less at-\\ntention towards the eÔ¨Éciency and performance of the al-\\ngorithms, as they have already been handled by the libraries\\nor APIs. Tese algorithms could even be applied to diÔ¨Äerent\\ndomains such as marketing, social media, search engines,\\nfraud detection, stock market analysis, e-business, authen-\\ntication, and so on by changing the training datasets and the\\nfeatures to be analysed. But in this review paper, the\\ncomputational\\nbiology\\nand\\nbiomedicine\\ndomain\\nwas\\nconsidered.\\nWhen coming back to precision medicine, as discussed\\npreviously, the simplest deÔ¨Ånition that could be provided\\nwould be treating patients based on their genetic, lifestyle,\\nand environmental data. Tis is simply not an easy task. It\\nneeds to have a whole load of data that should be analysed to\\nobtain the required knowledge for it. Tis is near impossible\\nfor humans to manually process. Furthermore, some rela-\\ntionships among data cannot be identiÔ¨Åed by humans after\\nexploring the dataset. But as discussed previously, unsu-\\npervised machine learning has been able to capture these\\nrelationships and group data according to the identiÔ¨Åed\\nrelationships. As precision medicine studies are involved\\nwith genes, it is certain that the biomedical event extraction\\nwould also contribute towards it. For a patient to then be\\ntreated using precision medicine, few approaches in com-\\nputational biology are vital, such as biomedical data analysis,\\ndisease diagnosis, and medical image analysis. Te reason is\\nthat categorizing the patients to identify the treatment to be\\nfollowed according to a set of considered factors needs better\\nobservations of the patient and his/her medical history.\\nTable 1: Applications of deep learning algorithms in computational biology [60].\\nDeep learning\\nalgorithm\\nMedical image analysis\\nProtein structure prediction\\nGenomic sequencing and gene\\nexpression analysis\\nConvolutional\\nneural network\\nBrain tumour segmentation, knee\\ncartilage segmentation, prediction of\\nsemantic descriptions from medical\\nimages, segmentation of MR brain\\nimages, coronary artery calcium scoring\\nin CT images\\nPrediction of protein order/\\ndisorder regions, prediction of\\nprotein secondary structures,\\nprediction of protein structure\\nproperties\\n‚Äî\\nSparse\\nautoencoder\\nOrgan detection in 4D patient data,\\nsegmentation of hippocampus from\\ninfant brains, histological\\ncharacterization of healthy skin and\\nhealing wounds\\nSequence-based prediction of\\nbackbone CŒ± angles and dihedrals\\n‚Äî\\nDeep belief\\nnetwork\\nSegmentation of left ventricle of the heart\\nfrom MR data, discrimination of retinal-\\nbased diseases\\nPrediction of protein disorder,\\nprediction of secondary structures,\\nlocal backbone angles\\nModelling structural binding\\npreferences and predicting binding\\nsites of RNA-binding proteins,\\nprediction of splice junction at DNA\\nlevel\\nDeep neural\\nnetwork\\nBrain tumour segmentation in MR\\nimages, prostate MR segmentation, gland\\ninstance segmentation\\n‚Äî\\nGene expression inference,\\nprediction of enhancer, prediction of\\nsplicing patterns in individual tissues\\nand diÔ¨Äerences in splicing patterns\\nacross tissues\\nRecurrent neural\\nnetwork\\nClassiÔ¨Åcation of patterns of EEG\\nsynchronization for seizure prediction,\\nEEG-based lapse detection\\nPrediction of protein secondary\\nstructure, prediction of protein\\ncontact map\\nPrediction of miRNA precursor and\\nmiRNA targets, detection of splice\\njunctions from DNA sequences\\nTable 2: Machine learning libraries in languages [8].\\nLanguage\\nTraditional machine learning libraries\\nDeep neural network machine learning libraries\\nPython\\nScikit-learn, PyBrain, Nilearn, Pattern, MILK,\\nMixtend\\nKeras, TensorÔ¨Çow (written in both C++ and Python), Nolearn, DeePy,\\nPylearn2\\nR\\nCaret, Boruta, GMMBoost, H2O, KlaR,\\nrminer\\nDarch, DeepNet\\nC++\\nShogun\\nCaÔ¨Äe, EBLearn, Intel Deep learning Framework, TensorÔ¨Çow (written in both\\nC++ and Python)\\nJava\\nEncog, Spark, Mahout, MALLET, Weka\\nDeeplearning4j\\nJavaScript\\nCluster, LDA, Node-SVM\\nConvnetJS\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\n17\\nTroughout this paper, on many occasions, the in-\\nvolvement of machine learning in computational biology\\nand biomedicine has been discussed. Te reason behind it is\\nthat more than 80% of the healthcare decisions are made\\nbased on the said areas. In addition to it, data analytics is\\nbeing applied in the healthcare sector to improve the\\nhealthcare services by predicting the future expectations\\nbased on a patient's medical history. Terefore, there is no\\ndoubt that prominent attention needs to be given towards\\nthe areas of computational biology and biomedicine when\\ndiscussing computational decision making in healthcare. But\\nit is to be highlighted that whenever we use an approach\\nrelated to artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence in healthcare, it is always\\nrelated to making a decision. Disease detection, disease\\nprediction, drug repurposing, precision medicine, medical\\nresource allocation, and much more can be shown as evi-\\ndence for it. In all of them, a machine learning algorithm\\neither makes a decision or least it would support a decision.\\nIt helps in solving a doubt that a clinician may have or\\nsometimes highlighting a fact which was not visible to the\\nclinician at the time of making a decision as a solution for a\\nhealthcare-related issue. In addition to it, most importantly,\\nit deals with people‚Äôs lives and even a simple mistake can\\nmake a huge impact on a person and even the society at\\nlarge. Terefore, computational decision making is so crucial\\nin the healthcare sector to make conÔ¨Ådent and accurate\\ndecisions in less time and at low cost. Tis has only been\\npossible with machine learning approaches being adapted as\\na tool in healthcare and is currently being extensively applied\\nin healthcare decisions.\\n10. Conclusion\\nWhile reaching the end of the paper, there is no doubt that\\nmachine learning algorithms, which is a subsection of ar-\\ntiÔ¨Åcial intelligence, have inspired the Ô¨Åeld of computational\\nbiology and have contributed immensely to the healthcare\\nsector in terms of fast, eÔ¨Écient, accurate, and cost-eÔ¨Äective\\ncomputational decision making. It is clearly visible that in\\nthe present context, machine learning has been applied in\\nvarious sections in the discussed Ô¨Åeld. Te involvement of\\nmachine learning can be found in disease diagnosis and\\nprediction, medical imaging, drug repurposing, biomedical\\nevent extraction, and much more in healthcare. But what is\\ncertain is that the journey that started with the integration of\\nmachine learning to computational biology has come a long\\nway passing several milestones and is now at a peak with the\\nintroduction of precision medicine. When considering all\\nthe above applications of machine learning in healthcare,\\nwhat is clearly visible is that how artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence has\\nbeen a key resource area for decision making in the\\nhealthcare sector in various aspects. When giving concern to\\nthe most recent applications of artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence in\\nhealthcare, the best example would be how diÔ¨Äerent tasks\\nsuch as patient care, treatment research, resource allocations\\nbased on the hospital volume, predictions and preparing for\\nfuture possible requirement, and so on were handled and\\nmanaged during the COVID-19 pandemic. With all that\\nbeing said, it is crystal clear that artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence had\\nplayed a huge role through machine learning to implement\\ncomputational decision making tools for the healthcare\\nsector, and in present times, they are of much importance\\nand could not be separated from the healthcare sector.\\nConflicts of Interest\\nTe authors declare that they have no conÔ¨Çicts of interest.\\nAcknowledgments\\nTe authors would like to specially thank the respective staÔ¨Ä\\nmembers in the Faculty of Information Technology of\\nUniversity of Moratuwa who guided and assisted them to\\nwrite this paper.\\nReferences\\n[1] S.

Due to the voluminous \\namounts of clinical data generated from the health care sec-\\ntor like the Electronic Health Records (EHR) of patients, \\nprescriptions, clinical reports, information about the pur-\\nchase of medicines, medical insurance-related data, investi-\\ngations, and laboratory reports, there lies an immense oppor-\\ntunity to analyze and study these using recent technologies \\n[2]. The huge volume of data can be pooled together and \\nanalyzed effectively using machine-learning algorithms. \\nAnalyzing the details and understanding the patterns in the \\ndata can help in better decision-making resulting in a better \\nquality of patient care.

Hence, the \\norganizations associated with healthcare must attempt to \\nprocure all the available tools and infrastructure to make use \\nof the big data, which can augment the revenue and profits \\nand can establish better healthcare networks, and stand apart \\nto reap significant benefits [4, 5]. Data mining techniques \\ncan create a shift from conventional medical databases to a \\nknowledge-rich, evidence-based healthcare environment in \\nthe coming decade.\\nBig data and its utility in healthcare and medical sciences \\nhave become more critical with the dawn of the social media \\nera (platforms such as Facebook and Twitter) and smart-\\nphone apps that can monitor personal health parameters \\nusing sensors and analyzers [6, 7]. The role of data mining is \\nto improvise the stored user information to provide superior \\ntreatment and care. This review article provides an insight \\ninto the advantages and methodologies of big data usage \\nin health care systems. It highlights the voluminous data \\ngenerated in these systems, their qualities, possible security-\\nrelated problems, data handling, and how this analytics sup-\\nport gaining significant insight into these data set.\\nSearch strategy\\nA non-systematic review of all data science, big data in \\nhealthcare-related English language literature published in \\nthe last decade (2010‚Äì2020) was conducted in November \\n2020 using MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, and Google \\nScholar. Our search strategy involved creating a search \\nstring based on a combination of keywords. They were: ‚ÄúBig \\nData,‚Äù ‚ÄúBig Data Analytics,‚Äù ‚ÄúHealthcare,‚Äù ‚ÄúArtificial Intel-\\nligence,‚Äù ‚ÄúAI,‚Äù ‚ÄúMachine learning,‚Äù ‚ÄúML,‚Äù ‚ÄúANN,‚Äù ‚ÄúCon-\\nvolutional Networks,‚Äù ‚ÄúElectronic Health Records,‚Äù ‚ÄúEHR,‚Äù \\n‚ÄúEMR,‚Äù ‚ÄúBioinformatics,‚Äù and ‚ÄúData Science.‚Äù We included \\noriginal articles published in English.\\nInclusion criteria\\n1.\\t Articles on big data analytics, data science, and AI.\\n2.\\t Full-text original articles on all aspects of application of \\ndata science in medical sciences.\\nExclusion criteria\\n1.\\t Commentaries, reviews, and articles with no full-text \\ncontext and book chapters.\\n2.\\t Animal, laboratory, or cadaveric studies.\\nThe literature review was performed as per the above-\\nmentioned strategy. The evaluation of titles and abstracts, \\nscreening, and the full article text was conducted for the \\nchosen articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Further-\\nmore, the authors manually reviewed the selected article‚Äôs \\nreferences list to screen for any additional work of interest. \\nThe authors resolved the disagreements about eligibility for \\na consensus decision after discussion.\\nKnowing more about¬†‚Äúbig data‚Äù\\nBig data consists of vast volumes of data, which cannot \\nbe managed using conventional technologies. Although \\nthere are many ways to define big data, we can consider \\nthe one defined by Douglas Laney [8] that represents three \\ndimensions, namely, volume, velocity, and variety (3 Vs). \\nThe ‚Äúbig‚Äù in big data implies its large volume. Velocity \\ndemonstrates the speed or rate at which data is processed. \\nVariety focuses on the various forms of structured and raw \\ndata obtained by any method or device, such as transaction-\\nlevel data, videos, audios, texts, emails, and logs. The 3 Vs \\nbecame the default description of big data, while many other \\nVs are added to the definition [9]. ‚ÄúVeracity‚Äù remains the \\nmost agreed 4th ‚ÄúV.‚Äù Data veracity focuses on the accuracy \\nand reliability of a dataset. It helps to filter through what is \\nimportant and what is not. The data with high veracity has \\nmany records that are valuable to analyze and that contribute \\nin a meaningful way to the overall results. This aspect poses \\nthe biggest challenge when it comes to big data. With so \\nmuch data available, ensuring that it is relevant and of high \\nquality is important. Over recent years, big data has become \\nincreasingly popular across all parts of the globe.\\nBig data needs technologically sophisticated applications \\nthat use high-end computing resources and Artificial Intel-\\nligence (AI)-based algorithms to understand such huge vol-\\numes of data. Machine learning (ML) approaches for auto-\\nmatic decision-making by applying fuzzy logic and neural \\nnetworks will be added advantage. Innovative and efficient \\nstrategies for dealing with data, smart cloud-based applica-\\ntions, effective storage, and user-friendly visualization are \\nrequired for big data to gain practical insights [10].\\nMedical care as¬†a¬†repository for¬†big data\\nHealthcare is a multilayered system developed specifically \\nfor preventing, diagnosing, and treating diseases. The key \\nelements of medical care are health practitioners (physicians \\nand nurses), healthcare facilities (which include clinics, drug \\ndelivery centers, and other testing or treatment technolo-\\ngies), and a funding agency that funds the former. Health \\ncare practitioners belong to different fields of health such as \\ndentistry, pharmacy, medicine, nursing, psychology, allied \\nhealth sciences, and many more. Depending on the sever-\\nity of the cases, health care is provided at many levels. In \\n1474\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\n1 3\\nall these stages, health practitioners need different forms of \\ninformation such as the medical history of the patient (data \\nrelated to medication and prescriptions), clinical data (such \\nas data from laboratory assessments), and other personal or \\nprivate medical data. The usual practice for a clinic, hospi-\\ntal, or patient to retain these medical documents would be \\nmaintaining either written notes or in the form of printed \\nreports [11].\\nThe clinical case records preserve the incidence and out-\\ncome of disease in a person‚Äôs body as a tale in the family, \\nand the doctor plays an integral role in this tale [12]. With \\nthe emergence of electronic systems and their capacity, digi-\\ntizing medical exams, health records, and investigations is \\na common procedure today. In 2003, the Institute of Medi-\\ncine, a division in the National Academies of Sciences and \\nEngineering coined the term ‚ÄúElectronic Health Records‚Äù \\nfor representing an electronic portal that saves the records of \\nthe patients. Electronic health records (EHRs) are automated \\nmedical records of patients related to an individual‚Äôs physi-\\ncal/mental health or significant reports that are saved in an \\nelectronic system and used to record, send, receive, store, \\nretrieve, and connect the medical personnel and patient with \\nmedical services [13].\\nOpen‚Äësource big data platforms\\nIt is an inefficient idea to work with big data or vast vol-\\numes of data into storage considering even the most power-\\nful computers. Hence, the only logical approach to process \\nlarge quantities of big data available in a complex form is \\nby spreading and processing it on several parallel connected \\nnodes. Nevertheless, the volume of the data is typically so \\nhigh that a large number of computing machines are needed \\nin a reasonable period to distribute and finish processing. \\nWorking with thousands of nodes involves coping with \\nissues related to paralleling the computation, spreading \\nof data, and manage failures. Table¬†1 shows the few open \\nsources of big data platforms and their utilities for data \\nscientists.\\nData mining\\nData types can be classified based on their nature, source, \\nand data collection methods [14]. Data mining techniques \\ninclude data grouping, data clustering, data correlation, and \\nmining of sequential patterns, regression, and data storage. \\nThere are several sources to obtain healthcare-related data \\n(Fig.¬†1). The most commonly used type (77%) is the data \\nTable‚ÄØ1‚ÄÇ ‚ÄâOpen  source big data platforms and their utilities\\nBig data tools\\nUtilities\\nApache Hadoop\\nIt is designed to scale up to thousands of machines from single servers, each of which offers local storage\\nThe framework enables users to easily build and validate distributed structures, distributes data, and operates across \\nmachines automatically\\nApache Spark\\nThe Hadoop Distributed File system (HDFS) and other data stores are flexible to work with\\nSpark offers integrated Application Program Interfaces (APIs) which enable users to write apps in different languages\\nApache Cassandra\\nCassandra is highly flexible and can add additional hardware that can handle more data and users on demand\\nCassandra adapts to all possible data types such as unstructured, structured, and semi-structured supporting features such as \\nAtomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID)\\nApache Storm\\nIn several cases, Apache Storm is easy to integrate with any programming language, with real-time analytics, online \\nmachine learning, and computation\\nApache Storm uses parallel calculations which run across a machine cluster\\nRapidMiner\\nRapidMiner provides a variety of products for a new process of data mining\\nIt provides an integrated data preparation environment, machine learning, text mining, visualization, predictive analysis, \\napplication development, prototype validation, and implementation. statistic modeling, deployment\\nCloudera\\nUsers can spin clusters, terminate them, and only pay for what they need\\nCloudera Enterprise can be deployed and run on AWS and Google Cloud Platforms by users\\nFig.‚ÄØ1‚ÄÇ ‚ÄâSources of big data in healthcare\\n1475\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\n1 3\\ngenerated by humans (HG data) which includes Electronic \\nMedical Records (EMR), Electronic Health Records (EHR), \\nand Electronic Patient Records (EPR). Online data through \\nWeb Service (WS) is considered as the second largest form \\nof data (11%) due to the increase in the number of people \\nusing social media day by day and current digital develop-\\nment in the medical sector [15]. Recent advances in the \\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)-based methodologies \\nare also making WS simpler to use [16]. The other data \\nforms such as Sensor Data (SD), Big Transactional Data \\n(BTD), and Biometric Data (BM) make around 12% of \\noverall data use, but wearable personal health monitoring \\ndevices‚Äô prominence and market growth [17] may need SD \\nand BM data.\\nApplications of¬†analytics in¬†healthcare\\nThere are six areas of applications of analytics in healthcare \\n(Fig.¬†2) including disease surveillance, health care manage-\\nment and administration, privacy protection and fraud detec-\\ntion, mental health, public health, and pharmacovigilance. \\nResearchers have implemented data extraction for data \\ndeposition and cloud-based computing, optimizing quality, \\nlowering costs, leveraging resources, handling patients, and \\nother fields.\\nDisease surveillance\\nIt involves the perception of the disease, understanding its \\ncondition, etiology (the manner of causation of a disease), \\nand prevention (Fig.¬†3).\\nInformation obtained with the help of EHRs, and the \\nInternet has a huge prospect for disease analysis. The various \\nsurveillance methods would aid the planning of services, \\nevaluation of treatments, priority setting, and the develop-\\nment of health policy and practice.\\nImage processing of¬†healthcare data \\nfrom¬†the¬†big data point of¬†view\\nImage processing on healthcare data offers valuable knowl-\\nedge about anatomy and organ functioning and identifies \\nthe disease and patient health conditions. The technique \\ncurrently has been used for organ delineation, identification \\nof lung tumors, diagnosis of spinal deformity, detection of \\narterial stenosis, detection of an aneurysm, etc. [18]. The \\nwavelets technique is commonly used for image process-\\ning techniques such as segmentation, enhancement, and \\nnoise reduction. The use of artificial intelligence in image \\nprocessing will enhance aspects of health care including \\nscreening, diagnosis, and prognosis, and integrating medi-\\ncal images with other types of data and genomic data will \\nincrease accuracy and facilitate early diagnosis of diseases \\n[18, 19]. The exponential increase in the count of medical \\nfacilities and patients has led to better use of clinical set-\\ntings of computer-based healthcare diagnostics and decision-\\nmaking systems.\\nData from¬†wearable technology\\nMulti-National Companies like Apple and Google are \\nworking on health-based apps and wearable technology as \\npart of a broader range of electronic sensors, the so-called \\nFig.‚ÄØ2‚ÄÇ ‚ÄâVarious applications of data science in healthcare\\nFig.‚ÄØ3‚ÄÇ ‚ÄâThe disease analysis system\\n1476\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\n1 3\\nIoT, and toolkits for healthcare-related apps. The pos-\\nsibility of collecting accurate medical data on real-time \\n(e.g., mood, diet followed, exercise, and sleep cycles pat-\\nterns), linked to physiological indicators (e.g., heart rate, \\ncalories burned, level of blood glucose, cortisol levels), is \\nperhaps discrete and omnipresent at minimum cost, unre-\\nlated to traditional health care. ‚ÄúTrue Colors‚Äù is a wear-\\nable designed to collect continuous patient-centric data \\nwith the accessibility and acceptability needed to allow \\nfor accurate longitudinal follow-up. More importantly, \\nthis system is presently being piloted as a daily health-\\nmonitoring substitute.\\nMedical signal analytics\\nTelemetry and the devices for the monitoring of physi-\\nological parameters generate large amounts of data. The \\ndata generated generally are retained for a shorter dura-\\ntion, and thus, extensive research into produced data is \\nneglected. However, advancements in data science in the \\nfield of healthcare attempt to ensure better management of \\ndata and provide enhanced patient care [20‚Äì23].\\nThe use of continuous waveform in health records con-\\ntaining information generated through the application of \\nstatistical disciplines (e.g., statistical, quantitative, con-\\ntextual, cognitive, predictive, etc.) can drive comprehen-\\nsive care decision-making. Data acquisition apart from an \\ningestion-streaming platform is needed that can control a \\nset of waveforms at various fidelity rates. The integration \\nof this waveform data with the EHR‚Äôs static data results in \\nan important component for giving analytics engine situ-\\national as well as contextual awareness. Enhancing the \\ndata collected by analytics will not just make the method \\nmore reliable, but will also help in balancing predictive \\nanalytics‚Äô sensitivity and specificity. The signal processing \\nspecies must mainly rely on the kind of disease population \\nunder observation.\\nVarious signal-processing techniques can be used to \\nderive a large number of target properties that are later \\nconsumed to provide actionable insight by a pre-trained \\nmachine-learning model. Such observations may be ana-\\nlytical, prescriptive, or predictive. Such insights can be \\nfurthermore built to activate other techniques such as \\nalarms and physician notifications. Maintaining these con-\\ntinuous waveforms‚Äìbased data along with specific data \\nobtained from the remaining sources in perfect harmony \\nto find the appropriate patient information to improve \\ndiagnosis and treatments of the next generation can be \\na daunting task [24]. Several technological criteria and \\nspecifications at the framework, analytical, and clinical \\nlevels need to be planned and implemented for the bedside \\nimplementation of these systems into medical setups.\\nHealthcare administration\\nKnowledge obtained from big data analysis gives health-\\ncare providers insights not available otherwise (Fig.¬†4). \\nResearchers have implemented data mining techniques to \\ndata warehousing as well as cloud computing, increasing \\nquality, minimizing costs, handling patients, and several \\nother fields of healthcare.\\nData storage and¬†cloud computing\\nData warehousing and cloud storage are primarily used for \\nstoring the increasing amount of electronic patient-centric \\ndata [25, 26] safely and cost-effectively to enhance medical \\noutcomes. Besides medical purposes, data storage is utilized \\nfor purposes of research, training, education, and quality \\ncontrol. Users can also extract files from a repository con-\\ntaining the radiology results by using keywords following \\nthe predefined patient privacy policy.\\nCost and¬†quality of¬†healthcare and¬†utilization \\nof¬†resources\\nThe migration of imaging reports to electronic medical \\nrecording systems offers tremendous potential for advancing \\nresearch and practice on radiology through the continuous \\nupdating, incorporation, and exchange of a large volume of \\ndata. However, the heterogeneity in how these data can be \\nformatted still poses major challenges. The overall objec-\\ntive of NLP is that the natural human language is translated \\ninto structured with a standardized set of value choices that \\nare easily manipulated into subsections or searches for the \\npresence or absence of a finding through software, among \\nother things [27].\\nGreaves et¬†al. [28] analyzed sentiment (computationally \\ndividing them into categories such as optimistic, pessimis-\\ntic, and neutral) based on the online response of patients \\nFig.‚ÄØ4‚ÄÇ ‚ÄâRole of big data in accelerating the treatment process\\n1477\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\n1 3\\nstating their overall experience to predict healthcare qual-\\nity. They found an agreement above 80% between online \\nplatform sentiment analysis and conventional paper-based \\nquality prediction surveys (e.g., cleanliness, positive con-\\nduct, recommendation). The newer solution can be a cost-\\neffective alternative to conventional healthcare surveys and \\nstudies. The physician‚Äôs overuse of screening and testing \\noften leads to surplus data and excess costs [29]. The present \\npractice in pathology is restricted by the emphasis on illness. \\nZhuang et¬†al. [29] compared the disease-based approach in \\nconjunction with database reasoning and used the data min-\\ning technique to build a decision support system based on \\nevidence to minimize the unnecessary testing to reduce the \\ntotal expense of patient care.\\nPatient data management\\nPatient data management involves effective scheduling and \\nthe delivery of patient care during the period of a patient‚Äôs \\nstay in a hospital. The framework of patient-centric health-\\ncare is shown in Fig.¬†5. Daggy et¬†al. [30] conducted a study \\non ‚Äúno shows‚Äù or missing appointments that lead to the clini-\\ncal capability that has been underused. A logistical regres-\\nsion model is developed using electronic medical records to \\nestimate the probabilities of patients to no-show and show \\nthe use of estimates for creating clinical schedules that opti-\\nmize clinical capacity use while retaining limited waiting \\ntimes and clinical extra-time. The 400-day clinical call-in \\nprocess was simulated, and two timetables were developed \\nper day: the conventional method, which assigns one patient \\nper appointment slot, and the proposed method, which \\nschedules patients to balance patient waiting time, additional \\ntime, and income according to no-show likelihood.\\nIf patient no-show models are mixed with advanced pro-\\ngramming approaches, more patients can be seen a day thus \\nenhancing clinical performance. The advantages of imple-\\nmentation of planning software, including certain method-\\nologies, should be considered by clinics as regards no-show \\ncosts [30].\\nA study conducted by Cubillas et¬†al. [31] pointed out \\nthat it takes less time for patients who came for adminis-\\ntrative purposes than for patients for health reasons. They \\nalso developed a statistical design for estimating the num-\\nber of administrative visits. With a time saving of 21.73% \\n(660,538¬†min), their model enhanced the scheduling sys-\\ntem. Unlike administrative data/target finding patients, a few \\ncome very regularly for their medical treatment and cover a \\nsignificant amount of medical workload. Koskela et¬†al. [32] \\nused both supervised and unsupervised learning strategies \\nto identify and cluster records; the supervised strategy per-\\nformed well in one cluster with 86% accuracy in distinguish-\\ning fare documents from the incorrect ones, whereas the \\nunsupervised technique failed. This approach can be applied \\nto the semi-automate EMR entry system [32].\\nPrivacy of¬†medical data and¬†fraudulency \\ndetection\\nThe anonymization of patient data, maintaining the privacy \\nof the medical data and fraudulency detection in health-\\ncare, is crucial. This demands efforts from data scientists \\nto protect the big data from hackers. Mohammed et¬†al. [33] \\nintroduced a unique anonymization algorithm that works \\nfor both distributed and centralized anonymization and dis-\\ncussed the problems of privacy security. For maintaining \\ndata usefulness without the loss of any data privacy, the \\nresearchers further proposed a model that performed far bet-\\nter than the traditional K-anonymization model. In addition \\nto this, their algorithm could also deal with voluminous, \\nmulti-dimensional datasets.\\nA mobile-based cloud-computing framework [34] of big \\ndata has been introduced to overcome the shortcomings of \\ntoday‚Äôs medical records systems. EHR data systems are \\nconstrained due to a lack of interoperability, size of data, \\nand privacy. This unique cloud-based system proposed to \\nstore EHR data from multiple healthcare providers within \\nFig.‚ÄØ5‚ÄÇ ‚ÄâElemental structure of patient-centric healthcare and ecosys-\\ntem\\n1478\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\n1 3\\nthe facility of an internet provider to provide authorized \\nrestricted access to healthcare providers and patients. They \\nused algorithms for encryption, One Time Password (OTP), \\nor a 2-factor authentication to ensure data security.\\nThe analytics of the big data can be performed using \\nGoogle‚Äôs efficient tools such as big query tools and MapRe-\\nduce. This approach will reduce costs, improve efficiency, \\nand provide data protection compared to conventional tech-\\nniques that are used for anonymization. The conventional \\napproach generally leaves data open to re-identification. \\nLi et¬†al. in a case study showed that hacking can make a \\nconnection between tiny chunks of information as well as \\nrecognize patients [35]. Fraud detection and abuse (i.e., sus-\\npicious care behavior, deliberate act of falsely representing \\nfacts, and unwanted repeated visits) make excellent use of \\nbig data analytics [36].\\nBy using data from gynecology-based reports, Yang et¬†al. \\nframed a system that manually distinguishes characteristics \\nof suspicious specimens from a set of medical care plans \\nthat any doctor would mostly adopt [37]. The technique was \\nimplemented on the data from Taiwan‚Äôs Bureau of National \\nHealth Insurance (BNHI), where the proposed technique \\nmanaged to detect 69% of the total cases as fraudulent, \\nenhancing the current model, which detected only 63% of \\nfraudulent cases. To sum up, the protection of patient data \\nand the detection of fraud are of significant concern due \\nto the growing usage of social media technology and the \\npropensity of people to place personal information on these \\nplatforms. The already existing strategies for anonymizing \\nthe data may become less successful if they are not imple-\\nmented because a significant section of the personal details \\nof everyone is now accessible through these platforms.\\nMental health\\nAccording to National Survey conducted on Drug Use \\nand Health (NSDUH), 52.2% of the total population in the \\nUnited States (U.S.) was affected by either mental problems \\nor drug addiction/abuse [38]. In addition, approximately 30 \\nmillion suffer from panic attacks and anxiety disorders [39].\\nPanagiotakopoulos et¬†al. [40] developed a data analy-\\nsis‚Äìfocused treatment technique to help doctors in manag-\\ning patients with anxiety disorders. The authors used static \\ninformation that includes personal information such as the \\nage of the individual, sex, body and skin types, and family \\ndetails and dynamic information like the context of stress, \\nclimate, and symptoms to construct static and dynamic \\ninformation based on user models. For the first three ser-\\nvices, relationships between different complex parameters \\nwere established, and the remaining one was mainly used to \\npredict stress rates under various scenarios. This model was \\nverified with the help of data collected from twenty-seven \\nvolunteers who are selected via the anxiety assessment sur-\\nvey. The applications of data analytics in the disease diag-\\nnosis, examination, or treatment of patients with mental \\nwellbeing are very different from using analytics to antici-\\npate cancer or diabetes. In this case, the data context (static, \\ndynamic, or non-observable environment) seems to be more \\nimportant compared to data volume [39].\\nThe leading cause of perinatal morbidity and death is \\npremature birth, but an exact mechanism is still unclear. The \\nresearch carried by Chen et¬†al. [41] intended to investigate \\nthe risk factors of preterm use of neural networks and deci-\\nsion tree C5.0 data mining. The original medical data was \\nobtained by a specialist study group at the National Uni-\\nversity of Taiwan from a prospective pregnancy cohort. A \\ntotal of 910 mother‚Äìchild dyads from 14,551 in the original \\ndata have been recruited using the nest case‚Äìcontrol design. \\nIn this data, thousands of variables are studied, including \\nbasic features, medical background, the climate and parents‚Äô \\noccupational factors, and the variables related to children. \\nThe findings suggest that the main risk factors for pre-born \\nbirth are multiple births, blood pressure during pregnancy, \\nage, disease, prior preterm history, body weight and height \\nof pregnant women, and paternal life risks associated with \\ndrinking and smoking. The results of the study are there-\\nfore helpful in the attempt to diagnose high-risk pregnant \\nwomen and to provide intervention early to minimize and \\navoid early births in parents, healthcare workers, and public \\nhealth workers [41, 42].\\nPublic health\\nData analytics have also been applied to the detection of dis-\\nease during outbreaks. Kostkova et¬†al. [43] analyzed online \\nrecords based on behavior patterns and media reporting the \\nfactors that affect the public as well as professional patterns \\nof search-related disease outbreaks. They found distinct fac-\\ntors affecting the public health agencies‚Äô skilled and layper-\\nson search patterns with indications for targeted communica-\\ntions during emergencies and outbreaks. Rathore et¬†al. [44] \\nhave suggested an emergency tackling response unit using \\nIoT-based wireless network of wearable devices called body \\narea networks (BANs). The device consists of ‚Äúintelligent \\nconstruction,‚Äù a model that helps in processing and decision \\nmaking from the data obtained from the sensors. The system \\nwas able to process millions of users‚Äô wireless BAN data to \\nprovide an emergency response in real-time.\\nConsultation online is becoming increasingly common \\nand a possible solution to the scarcity of healthcare resources \\nand inefficient delivery of resources. Numerous online con-\\nsultation sites do however struggle to attract customers who \\nare prepared to pay and maintain them, and health care pro-\\nviders on the site have the additional challenge to stand out \\n1479\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\n1 3\\nfrom a large number of doctors who can provide similar \\nservices [45]. In this research, Jiang et¬†al. [45] used ML \\napproaches to mine massive service data, in order (1) to \\ndefine the important characteristics related to patient pay-\\nment rather than free trial appointments, (2) explore the rela-\\ntive importance of those features, and (3) understand how \\nthese attributes work concerning payment, whether linearly \\nor not. The dataset refers to the largest online medical con-\\nsultation platform in China, covering 1,582,564 consulta-\\ntion documents among patient pairs between 2009 and 2018. \\nThe results showed that compared with features relating to \\nreputation as a physician, service-related features such as \\nquality of service (e.g., intensity of consultation dialogue \\nand response rate), the source of patients (e.g., online vs \\noffline patients), and the involvement of patients (e.g., social \\nreturns and previous treatments revealed). To facilitate pay-\\nment, it is important to promote multiple timely responses \\nin patient-provider interactions.\\nPharmacovigilance\\nPharmacovigilance requires tracking and identification of \\nadverse drug reactions (ADRs) after launch, to guarantee \\npatient safety. ADR events‚Äô approximate social cost per year \\nreaches a billion dollars, showing it as a significant aspect \\nof the medical care system [46]. Data mining findings from \\nadverse event reports (AERs) revealed that mild to lethal \\nreactions might be caused in paclitaxel among which doc-\\netaxel is linked with the lethal reaction while the remain-\\ning 4 drugs were not associated with hypersensitivity [47] \\nwhile testing ADR‚Äôs ‚Äúhypersensitivity‚Äù to six anticancer \\nagents [47]. Harpaz et¬†al. [46] disagreed with the theory \\nthat adverse events might be caused not just due to a single \\nmedication but also due to a mixture of synthetic drugs. It \\nis found that there is a correlation between a minimum of \\none drug and two AEs or two drugs and one AE in 84% \\nof AERs studies. Harpaz R et¬†al. [47] improved precision \\nin the identification of ADRs by jointly considering sev-\\neral data sources. When using EHRs that are available pub-\\nlicly in conjunction with the AER studies of the FDA, they \\nachieved a 31% (on average) increase in detection [45]. The \\nauthors identified dose-dependent ADRs with the help of \\nmodels built from structured as well as unstructured EHR \\ndata [48]. Of the top 5 ADR-related drugs, 4 were observed \\nto be dose-related [49]. The use of text data that is unstruc-\\ntured in EHRs [50]; pharmacovigilance operation was also \\ngiven priority.\\nADRs are uncommon in conventional pharmacovigi-\\nlance, though it is possible to get false signals while finding \\na connection between a drug and any potential ADRs. These \\nfalse alarms can be avoided because there is already a list of \\npotential ADRs that can be of great help in potential phar-\\nmacovigilance activities [18].\\nOvercoming the¬†language barrier\\nHaving electronic health records shared worldwide can be \\nbeneficial in analyzing and comparing disease incidence and \\ntreatments in different countries. However, every country \\nwould use their language for data recording. This language \\nbarrier can be dealt with the help of multilingual language \\nmodels, which would allow diversified opportunities for \\nData Science proliferation and to develop a model for per-\\nsonalization of services. These models will be able to under-\\nstand the semantics ‚Äî the grammatical structure and rules \\nof the language along with the context ‚Äî the general under-\\nstanding of words in different contexts.\\nFor example: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll meet you at the river bank.‚Äù\\n‚ÄúI have to deposit some money in my bank account.‚Äù\\nThe word bank means different things in the two contexts, \\nand a well-trained language model should be able to dif-\\nferentiate between these two. Cross-lingual language model \\ntrains on multiple languages simultaneously. Some of the \\ncross lingual language models include:\\nmBERT ‚Äî the multilingual BERT which was developed \\nby Google Research team.\\nXLM ‚Äî cross lingual model developed by Facebook AI, \\nwhich is an improvisation over mBERT.\\nMultifit ‚Äî a QRNN-based model developed by Fast.Ai \\nthat addresses challenges faced by low resource language \\nmodels.\\nChallenges\\nMillions of data points are accessible for EHR-based pheno-\\ntyping involving a large number of clinical elements inside \\nthe EHRs. Like sequence data, handling and controlling the \\ncomplete data of millions of individuals would also become \\na major challenge [51]. The key challenges faced include:\\n‚Ä¢\\t The data collected was mostly either unorganized or inac-\\ncurate, thus posing a problem to gain insights into it.\\n‚Ä¢\\t The correct balance between preserving patient-centric \\ninformation and ensuring the quality and accessibility of \\nthis data is difficult to decide.\\n‚Ä¢\\t Data standardization, maintaining privacy, efficient stor-\\nage, and transfers require a lot of manpower to constantly \\nmonitor and make sure that the needs are met.\\n‚Ä¢\\t Integrating genomic data into medical studies is criti-\\ncal due to the absence of standards for producing \\nnext-generation sequencing (NGS) data, handling bio-\\n1480\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\n1 3\\ninformatics, data deposition, and supporting medical \\ndecision-making [52].\\n‚Ä¢\\t Language barrier when dealing data\\nFuture directions\\nHealthcare services are constantly on the lookout for bet-\\nter options for improving the quality of treatment. It has \\nembraced technological innovations intending to develop \\nfor a better future. Big data is a revolution in the world of \\nhealth care. The attitude of patients, doctors, and health-\\ncare providers to care delivery has only just begun to \\ntransform. The discussed use of big data is just the ice-\\nberg edge. With the proliferation of data science and the \\nadvent of various data-driven applications, the health sec-\\ntor remains a leading provider of data-driven solutions to \\na better life and tailored services to its customers. Data \\nscientists can gain meaningful insights into improving \\nthe productivity of pharmaceutical and medical services \\nthrough their broad range of data on the healthcare sec-\\ntor including financial, clinical, R&D, administration, and \\noperational details.\\nConclusion\\nLarger patient datasets can be obtained from medical \\ncare organizations that include data from surveillance, \\nlaboratory, genomics, imaging, and electronic healthcare \\nrecords. This data requires proper management and analy-\\nsis to derive meaningful information. Long-term visions \\nfor self-management, improved patient care, and treat-\\nment can be realized by utilizing big data. Data Science \\ncan bring in instant predictive analytics that can be used \\nto obtain insights into a variety of disease processes and \\ndeliver patient-centric treatment. It will help to improvise \\nthe ability of researchers in the field of science, epide-\\nmiological studies, personalized medicine, etc. Predictive \\naccuracy, however, is highly dependent on efficient data \\nintegration obtained from different sources to enable it to be \\ngeneralized. Modern health organizations can revolutionize \\nmedical therapy and personalized medicine by integrating \\nbiomedical and health data. Data science can effectively \\nhandle, evaluate, and interpret big data by creating new \\npaths in comprehensive medical care.\\nFunding‚ÄÇ Open access funding provided by Manipal Academy of Higher \\n \\nEducation, Manipal.\\nDeclarations‚ÄÇ\\nConflict of interest‚ÄÇ The authors declare no competing interests.\\nOpen Access‚ÄÇ This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attri-\\nbution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adapta-\\ntion, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long \\nas you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, \\nprovide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes \\nwere made.

Advantages of machine learning include flexibility and scalability compared with traditional biostatistical methods, which makes it deployable for many tasks, such as risk stratification, diagnosis and classification, and survival predictions. Another advantage of machine learning algorithms is the ability to analyse diverse data types (eg, demographic data, laboratory findings, imaging data, and doctors' free-text notes) and incorporate them into predictions for disease risk, diagnosis, prognosis, and appropriate treatments. Despite these advantages, the application of machine learning in health-care delivery also presents unique challenges that require data pre-processing, model training, and refinement of the system with respect to the actual clinical problem.

The services provided during HHC include skilled \\nnursing care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and social work.2 As \\npart of routine HHC visits, clinicians assess for early signs of deterioration to reduce the \\nrisk of adverse events.3 Despite comprehensive assessments and interventions, nearly one \\nin five patients are hospitalized or visit the emergency department (ED) during the time \\nthey receive HHC services.4‚Äì6 Other initiatives aimed at hospitalization reduction include \\nfinancial incentives;4 however, readmission rates have not improved.7 Estimates show that \\napproximately 40% of hospitalizations and ED visits are due to preventable ambulatory \\ncare-sensitive conditions8 that could be avoided with timely and tailored interventions.9\\nIn recent years, there has been growing evidence that machine learning algorithms can \\npredict the risk of deterioration in patients by analyzing electronic health record (EHR) \\ndocumentation.10 HHC agencies have their own EHR which provides a central place to \\nHobensack et al.\\nPage 2\\nInt J Med Inform. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nstore information describing patients‚Äô diagnosis, problems, interventions, and outcomes. In \\nHHC, nurses are the largest group of clinicians, hence nursing documentation accounts \\nfor a majority of EHR documentation. Other users of the EHR in HHC include physical, \\noccupational, and speech therapists, and social workers.11 Machine learning algorithms can \\nidentify patients who may experience an adverse event by discovering patterns in previously \\ndocumented data.12 The value of machine learning has been demonstrated in the acute care \\nsetting to detect various adverse events13,14 such as mortality15 and the activation of rapid \\nresponse teams.16 This has led to the development of clinical decision support systems that \\nproactively notify clinicians to patients at risk for experiencing an adverse outcome.17,18 \\nHowever, the extent to which machine learning has been applied in the HHC setting for risk \\nprediction has not been previously reported.\\nAnother consideration when assessing the value of machine learning is understanding the \\npredictors driving the algorithm. Previous studies have demonstrated the versatility of \\nusing machine learning to examine a wide range of predictors from symptoms to social \\ndeterminants of health.19,20 However, while it is known that social determinants21 and \\npsychological factors influence health outcomes,22 the extent to which these factors are \\nincluded in machine learning algorithms in the HHC setting is unknown.19,20\\nRecent literature has called for an increase in informatics, such as machine learning, in the \\nHHC setting to bring documentation-driven evidence to clinicians at the point of care.23‚Äì25 \\nDespite HHC being one of the fastest growing sectors of healthcare26 and the benefits of \\nmachine learning to predict patients at risk,27 no previous studies have summarized the state \\nof the science on machine learning applied to EHR data in the HHC setting. To address these \\nknowledge gaps, this study aims to critically appraise and synthesize information on the \\napplication of machine learning to predict a priori specified adverse outcomes using EHR \\ndata in the HHC setting. Our secondary aim was to summarize the different dimensions \\nof predictors (i.e., biological, psychological, and interpersonal) used to build the machine \\nlearning algorithms guided by the Biopsychosocial Model.\\nMaterials and methods\\nThis scoping review was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items \\nfor Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) \\nguidelines.28 The protocol describing this study was registered in Open Science Framework \\n(osf.io/g5zrj). Studies were eligible to be included if they addressed skilled health services \\nprovided in HHC, applied machine learning algorithms to predict adverse outcomes a priori, \\nused EHR data, focused on the adult population, and were published in English. Full \\ntext papers and conference proceedings covering quantitative machine learning algorithms \\nwere included. For this study, adverse events were defined as outcomes related to patient \\ndeterioration.29 Studies were excluded if they took place in a nursing home or skilled \\nnursing facility or focused on smart homes, sensors, or robots because they were outside \\nthe scope of this manuscript. Qualitative studies, dissertation papers, and research proposals \\nwere excluded.\\nHobensack et al.\\nPage 3\\nInt J Med Inform.

There was no restriction on the publication date. The full search strategy \\ncan be found in Appendix A. Our screening team included two registered nurses and two \\nadvanced practice nurses with informatics expertise (MH, JS, DS, MT). After duplicates \\nwere removed, all relevant studies were screened by two reviewers. Any conflicts were \\nresolved through discussion between the three reviewers until consensus was reached. This \\nprocess was repeated with full-text studies.\\nThe data extraction template was drafted by two co-authors (MH, MT). Other co-authors \\nwere invited to modify the template prior to charting the items. The extraction template \\nincluded information about the study and sample characteristics, algorithm overview, \\nmachine learning approaches, and algorithm performance. Upon consensus with the \\nappropriate variables to extract (e.g., purpose, data source, best-performing algorithm), two \\nreviewers (JS, DS) independently charted the data using the software, Covidence. A third \\nreviewer went through and resolved any disagreements (MH).\\nData were synthesized by mapping predictors to the Biopsychosocial Model.31‚Äì33 This \\nmodel assumes that to understand health holistically, a range of characteristics should be \\nconsidered, including an individual‚Äôs social, psychological, and behavioral dimensions.31,32 \\nLehman et al adapted this model to include the following dimensions: biological, \\npsychological, and interpersonal.33 The biological dimension encompasses medical histories \\ninfluencing the physical body; the psychological dimension encompasses coping and health \\nbehaviors; and the interpersonal dimension encompasses social support.33 Two reviewers \\nwere tasked with categorizing the predictors into one of the three dimensions of the \\nBiopsychosocial Model. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus meetings with the \\nscreening team (MH, JS, DS).\\nFour reviewers (MH, JS, DS, MT) performed a risk of bias analysis using the Prediction \\nModel Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST).34 One reviewer (MH) resolved \\ndisagreements after discussing the conflicts with another member of the screening team \\nwho has expertise in machine learning (MT). PROBAST facilitates risk of bias assessment \\nin four domains: participants, predictors, outcome, and analysis, and is specific to prediction \\nmodel studies. Per the PROBAST guidelines, if a study has at least one criterion indicating \\nan unclear or high risk of bias, the overall risk of bias for that study would be unclear or \\nhigh.\\nResults\\nOur initial search yielded 1,644 studies from four databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, \\nand Scopus). After duplicates were removed (n = 190), there were 1,454 studies eligible \\nfor title and abstract screening. A total of 1,378 studies were excluded, and 76 studies \\nwere moved to full-text review. Of those, 20 studies were included for synthesis.

The \\nPRISMA flow diagram35 presented in Figure 1 summarizes the study selection process.\\nStudy characteristics\\nResults revealed the global advances in integrating machine learning into the HHC setting. \\nSix countries were represented in this review (30%). Ten studies (50%) did not include a \\nclear definition of HHC in their region. Most studies took place in the United States (n = 9; \\n45%)36‚Äì44 and Canada (n = 4; 20%)45‚Äì48 and used data retrospectively collected from 2015 \\nand earlier (n = 13; 65%)36‚Äì39,42‚Äì44,46,47,49‚Äì52 although some studies did not specify \\ndates (n = 3; 15%).40,48,53 The majority of studies were published between 2019 and 2022 (n \\n= 13; 65%).37,40‚Äì44,46,47,49,51,52,54,55\\nSample characteristics\\nMost studies did not focus on patients with a specific disease (n = 12; 60%). Among \\nstudies that did focus on a disease-specific population, patients with heart failure (n = 3; \\n15%)36,39,53 and advanced cancer (n = 2; 10%)50,55 were the most common. The number of \\nparticipants included in the studies ranged from 284 to 317,621. A summary of study and \\nsample characteristics is provided in Table 1.\\nAlgorithm overview\\nWhile all studies used data from the EHR, some studies included standardized assessments \\nstored in the EHR (n = 18; 90%).36‚Äì50,52,54,55 Standardized assessments, housed within the \\nEHR, include a set of standardized data elements allowing for easier comparison across \\ndifferent settings.56 For example, the United States‚Äô federally mandated Outcome and \\nAssessment Information Set (OASIS) assesses the patient‚Äôs functional status by collecting \\ndata about activities of daily living using a standardized set of questions such as describing \\nthe patient‚Äôs ability to ‚Äútransfer in and out of bed.‚Äù57 In the United States, EHR data \\n(e.g., demographics, clinical assessments) are typically collected by nurses within the \\nHHC agency,11 siloed from healthcare data collected in other care settings.23 The most \\ncited standardized assessment was the OASIS (n = 8; 40%)36‚Äì38,40‚Äì44 and Residential \\nAssessment Instrument - Home Care (RAI-HC) (n = 5; 25%).45‚Äì49 OASIS is a patient-\\nspecific assessment tool required by Medicare in the United States to guide a patient‚Äôs plan \\nof care, determine reimbursement, and collect quality measures in HHC.57 Similarly, the \\nRAI-HC is used in Canada to assess ‚Äúlong stay home care clients‚Äô health status, need for \\ncare, and basic background on housing and informal caregivers,‚Äù helping to guide care and \\ncollect quality indicators.58 In the included studies, only three studies included clinical notes \\nas a data source (15%).41,43,44\\nMost studies considered variables from all three domains of the Biopsychosocial Model (n = \\n12; 60%): biological (e.g., age, hematocrit, fall history), psychological (e.g., depression, \\nmemory deficit, coping), and interpersonal (e.g., lives alone, social support, informal \\ncaregiver status).38,40‚Äì42,44‚Äì50,52 Predictors that did not map to one of the three domains \\nwere categorized as ‚ÄúOther‚Äù which included variables such as the number of days in the \\nhospital, hospital utilization history, and the number of HHC visits.

Although \\nsimilar reviews were conducted in the acute and ambulatory settings,64,65 this study was the \\nfirst to focus on the HHC setting, which represents one of the fastest-growing healthcare \\nsectors.26\\nMost studies (65%) included in this review were published between 2019 and 2022, \\nsuggesting a recent uptake of machine learning in the HHC setting.64,66 With that, 65% \\nof the studies used data collected from 2015 or earlier, indicating a delay between \\nretrospective data availability and analysis. This may be related to the lack of regulation \\nand standardization of EHR systems and data collected in the HHC setting globally, \\nwhich may increase the difficulty and time needed to extract, clean, and analyze the \\ndata.67,68 Generating global policies similar to the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care \\nTransformation (IMPACT) Act, which advances standardized data in post-acute care \\nsettings69 could lead to improved interoperability and analytical efficiency in the near future.\\nThis review paper highlights a gap in current research around the implementation of \\nmachine learning algorithms into the HHC clinical setting.30 A previous systematic review \\ndescribing prediction algorithms in post-acute care found that among the 37 models \\nreviewed, very few were ever implemented in practice.70 While clinical validation is \\nunderway in the acute care setting through randomized controlled trials,71‚Äì73 there is still \\na significant gap in the HHC setting. Shifting focus from an end goal of performance \\noptimization to practical clinical implementation is imperative to achieve the intention of \\nalmost all health-related machine learning algorithms ‚Äì to advance health and improve \\noutcomes. Seneviratne et al recommends that when building machine learning algorithms, \\ndevelopers should proactively consider clinical actionability, patient safety, and cost-utility \\nto optimize implementation in the clinical setting.74\\nAlthough this study examined the global scope of machine learning in HHC across six \\ncountries, it is important to highlight some regional differences. For example, in the United \\nStates, HHC is defined as a period of 30 to 60 days where skilled services such as nursing, \\nphysical, occupational, and speech therapy are provided to help patients transition back to \\nthe community.42,44 Alternatively, in Spain, the purpose of HHC is to provide interventions \\naimed at substituting inpatient hospitalization in a period of time that does not exceed \\nthe expected length of an inpatient hospitalization.52 Concerningly, half of the studies \\nincluded in this review did not provide detailed information on the structure of HHC in their \\ncountry. The differences in HHC structure and purpose also influence EHR documentation75 \\nwhich was not thoroughly discussed in all articles. Given the variation of HHC and EHRs \\nglobally,76‚Äì78 future studies should provide a detailed description of their regional HHC \\nstructure and EHR systems to help distinguish differences in patient populations, goals, \\ntimelines, and care structures. Providing further clarity around regional differences in the \\nHobensack et al.\\nPage 7\\nInt J Med Inform. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nstructure of HHC and EHR systems could lead to better tailoring and predictor selection \\nwhen developing machine learning algorithms globally.\\nStandardized assessments, such as OASIS and the RAI-HC, are commonly stored in the \\nEHR. Using standardized assessments can support interoperability, or the ability to exchange \\nhealth information, across systems or within a health system.79 In addition, the utilization \\nof standardized assessments has led to more evidence-based, consistent, and holistic \\nassessments among clinicians.80,81 In fact, all three domains of the Biopsychosocial Model \\nwere aligned with studies that used a standardized assessment tool as their data source, \\nsuggesting that standardized assessments lead to more comprehensive documentation. Thus, \\nincorporating standardized assessments into the EHR could improve comparability, access to \\ndata, interoperability, and generalizability in the HHC setting.\\nOur results reveal that most studies include predictors from all three domains of the \\nBiopsychosocial Model. Unsurprisingly, and similar to a previous study,82 biological \\ncharacteristics were included in all studies. Fewer studies included psychological (e.g., \\nmental health) and/or interpersonal (e.g., social determinants of health) predictors in their \\nmachine learning algorithms. Of the studies that did include these dimensions, they were \\noften from the structured standardized assessments. For psychological predictors, this may \\nbe related to using an assessment tool that does not comprehensively consider psychological \\ncharacteristics. For interpersonal predictors, this might be related to limited data capture \\nand documentation of social determinants of health in EHR systems.83 Previous studies \\nhave suggested that including social determinants of health can improve machine learning \\nprediction among individuals from racial or ethnic minorities.21,84,85 The inclusion of \\npsychological and interpersonal characteristics in machine learning algorithms could lead to \\nimproved equity in risk identification85 and proactive interventions for patients with mental \\nhealth conditions or social risk factors who are often stigmatized in healthcare.86,87\\nThe most frequently cited outcome of interest was hospitalization. In HHC, one of the \\nprimary goals is to prevent avoidable hospitalizations.88 Hospitalization rates reflect care \\nquality,4 with reducing readmission being financially incentivized;4 thus, we anticipate \\nthe number of machine learning algorithms focused on hospitalization to continue to be \\ncommon. Other outcomes specific to HHC, such as self-management, should be explored in \\nfuture studies to investigate other ways to reduce the risk of specific adverse outcomes prior \\nto hospitalization.89 In terms of disease conditions, a majority of the studies in this review \\ndid not focus on patients with a specific disease but rather on the general HHC population. \\nThe few studies that specified a condition focused on patients with heart failure or cancer. \\nFuture studies might examine specific disease-related predictors to identify characteristics \\nthat put specific populations at risk and inform the development of tailored interventions to \\nimprove patient outcomes.\\nThe wide range of sample sizes in the included studies demonstrates the versatility \\nof machine learning algorithms in studies with various sample sizes.90 Although small \\nsamples can be problematic for specific algorithms, such as Neural networks, other \\nalgorithms, such as Na√Øve bayes, can better accommodate smaller samples since it assumes \\nclass independence.91 However, data-demanding algorithms like Neural networks may \\nHobensack et al.\\nPage 8\\nInt J Med Inform. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nbe more prone to overfitting with smaller samples, leading to overestimated algorithm \\nperformance.92 Thus, we encourage researchers to consider sample size when determining \\nthe appropriate algorithm to apply to the data.\\nTree based algorithms (e.g., Decision tree, ADABoost, Classification and regression trees, \\nRandom forest) were frequently cited in this review and are known to be a reliable method \\nin biomedical literature.93 An advantage of a Decision tree is its interpretability,94 meaning \\nthat humans can understand the informative features driving the algorithm‚Äôs performance.95 \\nAlternatively, ‚Äúblack box‚Äù algorithms, such as Neural networks, are less interpretable, which \\nmay indicate why they were used less frequently94 in studies included in this review. \\nHowever, there has been a rise in the use of Neural networks96,97 applied to EHR data, given \\nits increased performance and reduction in preprocessing and feature engineering compared \\nto other explainable algorithms.97 Recent literature has published model-agnostic methods \\nto increase the interpretability of ‚Äúblack box‚Äù models, such as Shapley Values, which help \\nto explain features that are more informative (i.e., feature importance).95 Therefore, future \\nstudies may be more apt to apply Neural networks in the HHC setting. However, the studies \\nin this review that applied Neural networks did not outperform alternative algorithms, \\nsuggesting that other models should not be abandoned altogether.\\nAdditionally, NLP, an algorithm used to process unstructured text in clinical notes, was \\ninfrequently applied in studies included in this review. NLP is a method that takes \\ntext contained in clinical notes and makes it accessible to machine learning algorithms \\nby transforming the text into a structured form.98 Eighty percent of healthcare data is \\nunstructured data (e.g., clinical notes).99 Previous studies have demonstrated the value \\nof analyzing clinical notes to reflect clinician concerns to improve risk prediction in \\nHHC.44,100‚Äì102 More specifically, studies have found that additional information about \\npatients‚Äô social determinants103 and mental health104 can be found in clinical notes. Thus, \\nfuture studies in HHC might explore using NLP to extract additional information about \\na patient‚Äôs biological, psychological, and interpersonal characteristics to improve risk \\npredictive performance.\\nOverall, there were variations in algorithm performance among the included studies; \\nhowever, comparing algorithms with different performance metrics is challenging. Each \\nperformance metric has its advantages and disadvantages. F-score, which handles \\nimbalanced data, gives more weight to the majority class regardless of if it is the outcome \\nof interest.105 AUC is better for ranking overall prediction because it equally weights \\nboth classes.105 The variety of measures used to report algorithm performance suggests \\nno general consensus on a particular measure of best use.106 Therefore, it is important \\nthat the selection of performance metrics is thoughtfully considered and explained in the \\nmanuscript.107\\nLimitations\\nA few limitations of this scoping review need to be addressed. First, we recognize that \\nsub-optimal machine learning performance may be driven by the dataset‚Äôs quality and \\ninfluence the results. Additionally, the development of machine learning in recent years may \\nHobensack et al.\\nPage 9\\nInt J Med Inform. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nhave contributed to improved machine learning performance. The scope of this study did \\nnot include an in-depth analysis of how the data was collected, but future studies should \\nconsider the bias contained in these data. Similarly, no studies rigorously evaluated bias \\n(e.g., racial, age) in algorithm performance recognizing an important gap to consider in \\nfuture research. This review did not find HHC studies that compared prediction of machine \\nlearning models with clinical expert judgment and we recommend exploring this comparison \\nin the future studies. This scoping review contains multiple studies published by the same \\nresearch team, which suggests that minimal teams have published in this area within the \\nlast few years, potentially skewing the results. We mapped predictors to the Biopsychosocial \\nModel to get a comprehensive overview of predictors considered in the included machine \\nlearning models; however, an alternative framework may have led to a more granular \\ncategorization of predictors.\\nConclusion\\nWith the increased demand for healthcare provided in the home, we anticipate the number \\nof machine learning algorithms in HHC to continue to increase. Results from this review \\ndemonstrate the feasibility and potential of machine learning to support clinical care in the \\nHHC setting. Future studies should consider how these machine learning algorithms can \\nbe packaged into decision support systems that can guide clinical decision-making at the \\npoint of care to reduce adverse events, such as hospitalizations. In addition, incorporating \\npsychological and interpersonal characteristics into machine learning models will support \\ncomprehensive, holistic risk prediction. To enable widespread adoption of machine \\nlearning, stakeholders should consider how they can further promote the standardization \\nof documentation elements in the HHC setting.\\nSupplementary Material\\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis work was supported by the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) [grant T32NR007969 (MH, DS), \\nR01 NR018831]; the Jonas Scholarship (MH), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [grant R01 \\nHS027742].\\nReferences\\n1.

INTRODUCTION\\nAs machine learning (ML) models proliferate into many aspects of our lives, there is \\ngrowing concern regarding their ability to inflict harm. In medicine, excitement about \\nhuman-level performance (1) of ML for health is balanced against ethical concerns, such \\nas the potential for these tools to exacerbate existing health disparities (2‚Äì5). For instance, \\nrecent work has demonstrated that state-of-the-art clinical prediction models underperform \\non women, ethnic and racial minorities, and those with public insurance (6).

Even more worrisome, healthcare models designed \\nto optimize referrals to long-term care management programs for millions of patients have \\nbeen found to exclude Black patients with similar health conditions compared to white \\npatients from care management programs (8).\\nMachine learning (ML):\\nthe study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience\\nML model:\\nan algorithm that has been trained on data for a specific use case\\nAlgorithm:\\na finite sequence of well-defined instructions used to solve a class of problems\\nA growing body of literature wrestles with the social implications of ML and technology. \\nSome of this work, termed critical data studies, is from a social science perspective (9, \\n10), whereas other work leads with a technical and computer science perspective (11‚Äì13). \\nWhile there is scholarship addressing social implications and algorithmic fairness in general, \\nthere has been less work at the intersection of health, ML, and fairness (14‚Äì16), despite the \\npotential life-or-death impacts of ML models (8, 17).\\nAlgorithmic fairness:\\nthe study of definitions and methods related to the justice of models\\nWhile researchers looking to develop ethical ML models for health can begin by drawing \\non bioethics principles (18, 19), these principles are designed to inform research and \\nclinical care practices. How these principles could inform the ML model development \\nethical pipeline remains understudied. We note that there has been significant work on other \\nimportant ethical issues that relate to ML and health, including reviews of consent and \\nprivacy (20), which we do not address here. Instead, we focus on equity in ML models that \\noperate on health data. We focus primarily on differences between groups induced by, or \\nrelated to, the model development pipeline, drawing on both the bioethics principle of justice \\nand the established social justice centering of public health ethics (21). Unjust differences in \\nquality and outcomes of healthcare between groups often reflect existing societal disparities \\nfor disadvantaged groups. We consider other bioethics principles such as beneficence and \\nnonmaleficence, but focus them primarily on groups of patients rather than on individuals.\\nChen et al.\\nPage 2\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

Here, we motivate the ethical considerations in the pipeline with a case \\nstudy of Black mothers in the United States, who die in childbirth at a rate three times \\nhigher than white women (22). This inequity is unjust because it connects to a history of \\nreproductive injustices faced by Black women in the United States, from gynecological \\nexperimentation on enslaved women to forced sterilizations (23, 24).\\n1.\\nProblem selection: This disparity occurs in part during problem selection \\nbecause maternal mortality is an understudied problem (25).\\n2.\\nData collection: Even after accounting for problem selection, data collection \\nfrom hospitals may differ in quality and quantity. For example, 75% of Black \\nwomen give birth at hospitals that serve predominantly Black patients (26), but \\nBlack-serving hospitals have higher rates of maternal complications than other \\nhospitals (27).\\n3.\\nOutcome definition: Once data are collected, the choice of outcome definition \\ncan obscure underlying issues, e.g., differences in clinical practice.

Because \\nBlack women have a heightened risk of pregnancy-related death across income \\nand education levels (30), a biased prediction model could potentially automate \\npolicies or risk scores that disadvantage Black mothers.\\nModel outcome:\\nthe output of interest for predictive models\\nConfounding:\\nthe condition in which a feature influences both the dependent variable and independent \\nvariable, causing a spurious association\\nRisk score:\\na calculated number denoting the likelihood of adverse event\\nWe organize the rest of this review sequentially expanding on each of the five steps in the \\npipeline described above and in Figure 1. First, we look at problem selection, and explain \\nhow funding for ML for health research can lead to injustice. We then examine how data \\ncollection processes in funded research can amplify inequity and unfairness. We follow this \\nby exploring outcome definition and algorithm building, listing the multitude of factors that \\ncan impact model performance and explaining how these differences in performance relate \\nto issues of justice. We close with audits that should be considered for more robust and just \\ndeployments of models in health, as well as recommendations to practitioners for ethical, \\nfair, and just ML deployments.\\n2. PROBLEM SELECTION\\nThere are many factors that influence the selection of a research problem, from interest \\nto available funding. However, problem selection can also be a matter of justice if the \\nresearch questions that are proposed, and ultimately funded, focus on the health needs of \\nadvantaged groups. Below we provide examples of how disparities in research teams and \\nfunding priorities exacerbate existing socioeconomic, racial, and gender injustices.\\nChen et al.\\nPage 4\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\n2.1. Global Health Injustice\\nThe so-called 10/90 gap refers to the fact that the vast majority of health research dollars \\nare spent on problems that affect a small fraction of the global population (31, 32). Diseases \\nthat are most common in lower-income countries receive far less funding than diseases \\nthat are most common in high-income countries (33) (relative to the number of individuals \\nthey affect). As an example, 26 poverty-related diseases account for 14% of the global \\ndisease burden, but receive only 1.3% of global health-related research and development \\nexpenditure. Nearly 60% of the burden of poverty-related neglected diseases occurs in \\nwestern and eastern sub-Saharan Africa, as well as South Asia. Malaria, tuberculosis, and \\nHIV/AIDS all have shares of global health-related research and development expenditure \\nthat are at least five times smaller than their share of global disease burden (33). This \\ndifference in rates of funding represents an injustice because it further exacerbates the \\ndisadvantages faced by populations in the Global South. While efforts like the ‚ÄúAll Of \\nUs‚Äù Research Program (34) and 23andMe‚Äôs call for collaboration (35) seek to collect more \\ninclusive data, these efforts have come under criticism for not reflecting global health \\nconcerns, particularly among Indigenous groups (36).\\nGlobal South:\\ncountries on one side of the North‚ÄìSouth divide, the other side being the countries of the \\nGlobal North\\n2.2. Racial Injustice\\nRacial bias affects which health problems are prioritized and funded. For example, sickle \\ncell disease and cystic fibrosis are both genetic disorders of similar severity, but sickle cell \\ndisease is more common in Black patients, while cystic fibrosis is more common in white \\npatients. In the United States, however, cystic fibrosis receives 3.4 times more funding per \\naffected individual from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the largest funder of \\nUS clinical research, and hundreds of times more private funding (37). The disparities in \\nfunding persist despite the 1972 Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act, which recognizes that \\nsickle cell has been neglected by the wider research community. Further, screening for sickle \\ncell disease is viewed by some as unfair targeting (38), and Black patients with the disease \\nwho seek treatment are often maligned as drug abusers (39).\\n2.3. Gender Injustice\\nWomen‚Äôs health conditions like endometriosis are poorly understood; as a consequence, \\neven basic statistics like the prevalence of endometriosis remain unknown, with estimates \\nranging from 1% to 10% of the population (40, 41). Similarly, the menstrual cycle is \\nstigmatized and understudied (40, 42), producing a dearth of understanding that undermines \\nthe health of half the global population. Basic facts about the menstrual cycle‚Äîincluding \\nwhich menstrual experiences are normal and which are predictive of pathology‚Äîremain \\nunknown (40). This lack of focus on the menstrual cycle propagates into clinical practice \\nand data collection despite evidence that it affects many aspects of health and disease (43, \\n44). Menstrual cycles are also not often recorded in clinical records and global health \\nChen et al.\\nPage 5\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\ndata (40). In fact, until 2019 the NIH did not have an R01 grant, the NIH‚Äôs original and \\nhistorically oldest grant mechanism, relating to the influence of sex and gender on health \\nand disease (45). Notably, recent work has moved to target such understudied problems \\nvia ambulatory women‚Äôs health-tracking mobile apps. These crowd-sourcing efforts stand \\nto accelerate women‚Äôs health research by collecting data from cohorts that are orders of \\nmagnitude larger than those used in previous studies (40).\\n2.4. Diversity of the Scientific Workforce\\nThe diversity of the scientific workforce profoundly influences the problems studied \\nand contributes to biases in problem selection (46). Research shows that scientists from \\nunderrepresented racial and gender groups tend to prioritize different research topics. They \\nproduce more novel research, but their innovations are taken up at lower rates (47). Female \\nscientists tend to study different scientific subfields, even within the same larger field [for \\nexample, within sociology, they have been historically better represented on papers about \\nsociology of the family or early childhood (48)], and express different opinions about ethical \\ndilemmas in computer science (49). Proposals from white researchers in the United States \\nare more likely to be funded by the NIH than proposals from Black researchers (50, 51), \\nwhich in turns affects what topics are given preference. For example, a higher fraction of \\nNIH proposals from Black scientists study community and population-level health (50). \\nOverall, this evidence suggests that diversifying the scientific workforce will lead to problem \\nselection that more equitably represents the interests and needs of the population as a whole.\\n3. DATA COLLECTION\\nThe role of health data is ever-expanding, with new data sources routinely being integrated \\ninto decision-making around health policy and design. This wealth of high-quality data, \\ncoupled with advancements in ML models, has played a significant role in accelerating \\nthe use of computationally informed policy and practice to strengthen healthcare and \\ndelivery platforms. Unfortunately, data can be biased in ways that have (or can lead to) \\ndisproportionate negative impacts on already marginalized groups. First, data on group \\nmembership can be completely absent. For instance, countries such as Canada and France \\ndo not record race and ethnicity in their nationalized health databases (52, 53), making \\nit impossible to study race-based disparities and hypotheses around associations of social \\ndeterminants of health. Second, data can be imbalanced. Recent work on acute kidney injury \\nachieved state-of-the-art prediction performance in a large dataset of 703,782 adult patients \\nusing 620,000 features; however, the authors noted that model performance was lower in \\nfemale patients since they make up 6.38% of patients in the training data (54). Other work \\nhas indicated that this issue cannot be simply addressed by pretraining a model in a more \\nbalanced data setting prior to fine-tuning on an imbalanced dataset (55). This indicates that a \\nmodel cannot be initialized with a balanced baseline representation that ameliorates issues of \\nimbalance in downstream tasks, and it suggests that we must solve this problem at the root, \\nbe it with more balanced comprehensive data, specialty learning algorithms, or combinations \\nthereof. Finally, while some sampling biases can be recognized and possibly corrected, \\nothers may be difficult to correct. For example, work in medical imaging has demonstrated \\nChen et al.\\nPage 6\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nthat models may overlook unforeseen stratification of conditions, like rare manifestations of \\ndiseases, which can result in harm in clinical settings (16, 56).\\nTraining data:\\ninformation that a ML model fits to and learns patterns from\\nIn this section, we discuss common biases in data collection. We consider two types of \\nprocesses that result in a loss of data. First, we examine processes that affect what kind \\nof information is collected (heterogenous data loss) across varying input types. Examples \\ninclude clinical trials with aggressive inclusion criteria or social media data that reflect \\nthose with access to devices hosting social media apps. Second, we examine processes that \\naffect whether an individual‚Äôs information is collected due to the individual‚Äôs population \\ntype (population-specific data losses), often across data input categories. For example, \\nundocumented immigrants may fear deportation if they participate in healthcare systems.\\nPopulation-specific data loss:\\nthe process whereby data can be lost in collection due to the features of the population\\n3.1. Heterogeneous Data Losses\\nSome data loss is specific to the data type, due to assumptions about noise that may have \\nbeen present during the collection process. However, data noise and missingness can cause \\nunjust inequities that impact populations in different ways. We cover four main data types: \\nrandomized controlled trials (RCTs), electronic health records (EHRs), administrative health \\ndata, and social media data.\\nHeterogeneous data loss:\\nthe process whereby data can be lost in collection due to the data type\\nData noise:\\nmeaningless information added to data that obscures the underlying information of the \\ndata\\nMissingness:\\nthe manner in which data are absent from a sample of the population\\n3.1.1. Randomized controlled trials.‚ÄîRCTs are often run specifically to gather \\nunbiased evidence of treatment effects. However, RCTs have notoriously aggressive \\nexclusion (or inclusion) criteria (57), which create study cohorts that are not representative \\nof general patient populations (58). In one study of RCTs used to define asthma treatment, \\nChen et al.\\nPage 7\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nan estimated 94% of the adult asthmatic population would not have been eligible for the \\ntrials (59). There is a growing methodological literature designing methods to generalize \\nRCT treatment effects to other populations (60). However, current empirical evidence \\nindicates that such generalizations can be challenging given available data or may require \\nstrong assumptions in practice.\\nRandomized controlled trial (RCT):\\na study in which subjects are allocated by chance to receive one of several interventions\\n3.1.2. Electronic health records.‚ÄîMuch recent work in ML also leverages large EHR \\ndata. EHR data are a complex reflection of patient health, healthcare systems, and providers, \\nwhere data missingness is a known, and meaningful, problem (61). As one salient example, \\na large study of laboratory tests to model three-year survival found that healthcare process \\nfeatures had a stronger predictive value than the patient‚Äôs physiological feaures (62). Further, \\nnot all treatments investigated in RCTs can be easily approximated in EHRs (63).\\nElectronic health record (EHR):\\ndigital version of a patient‚Äôs clinical history that is maintained by the provider over time\\nBiases in EHR data may arise due to differences in patient populations, access to care, \\nor the availability of EHR systems (64). As an example, the widely used MIMIC-III \\nEHR dataset includes most patients who receive care at the intensive care units in Beth \\nIsrael Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), but this sample is obviously limited by which \\nindividuals have access to care at BIDMC, which has a largely white patient population \\n(14). In the United States, uninsured Black and Hispanic or Latin(o/x) patients, as well as \\nHispanic or Latin(o/x) Medicaid patients, are less likely to have primary care providers with \\nEHR systems, as compared to white patients with private insurance (65). Other work has \\nshown that gender discrimination in healthcare access has not been systematically studied in \\nIndia, primarily due to a lack of reliable data (66).\\n3.1.3. Administrative health records.‚ÄîIn addition to RCTs and EHRs, healthcare \\nbilling claims data, clinical registries, and linked health survey data are also common \\ndata sources in population health and health policy research (67, 68), with known biases \\nconcerning which populations are followed and who is able to participate. Translating \\nsuch research into practice is a crucial part of maintaining healthcare quality, and limited \\nparticipation of minority populations by sexual orientation and gender identity (69), race and \\nethnicity (70), and language (71) can lead to health interventions and policies that are not \\ninclusive and can create new injustices for these already marginalized groups.\\nIntervention:\\na treatment, procedure, or other action taken to prevent or treat disease or improve health \\nin other ways\\nChen et al.\\nPage 8\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\n3.1.4. Social media data.‚ÄîData from social media platforms and search-based \\nresearch naturally consist of only individuals with internet access (72). Even small \\nchoices like limiting samples to those from desktop versus mobile platforms constitute \\na problematic distinction in non‚ÄìNorth American contexts (73). Beyond concerns about \\naccess to resources or geographic limitations, data collection and scraping pipelines for most \\nsocial media cohorts do not yield a random sample of individuals. Further, the common \\npractice of limiting analysis to those satisfying a specified threshold of occurrence can lead \\nto skewed data. As an example, when processing the large volume of Twitter data (7.6 \\nbillion tweets), researchers may first restrict to users who can be mapped to a US county \\n(1.78 billion), then to those Tweets that contain only English (1.64 billion tweets), and \\nfinally to users who made more than 30 posts (1.53 billion) (74).\\n3.2. Population-Specific Data Losses\\nAs with data types, the modern data deluge does not apply equally to all communities. \\nHistorically underserved groups are often underrepresented, misrepresented, or entirely \\nmissing from health data that inform consequential health policy decisions. When \\nindividuals from disadvantaged communities appear in observational datasets, they are \\nless likely to be accurately captured due to errors in data collection and systemic \\ndiscrimination. Larger genomics datasets often target European populations, producing \\ngenetic risk scores that are more accurate in individuals of European ancestry than other \\nancestries (75). We note four specific examples of populations that are commonly impacted: \\nlow- and middle-income nationals, transgender and gender nonconforming individuals, \\nundocumented migrants, and pregnant women.\\n3.2.1. Low- and middle-income nationals.‚ÄîHealth data are infrequently collected \\ndue to resource constraints, and even basic disease statistic data such as prevalence of \\nmortality rates can be challenging to find for low- and middle-income nations (73). When \\ndata are collected, they are not digitized and often contain errors. In 2001, the World Health \\nOrganization found that only 9 out of the 46 member states in sub-Saharan Africa could \\nproduce death statistics for a global assessment of the burden of disease, with data coverage \\noften less than 60% in these countries (76).\\n3.2.2. Transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals.‚ÄîThe healthcare \\nneeds and experiences of transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals are not well \\ndocumented in datasets (77) because documented sex, not gender identity, is what is \\nusually available. However, documented sex is often discordant with gender identity \\nfor transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals. Apart from health documentation \\nconcerns, transgender people are often concerned about their basic physical safety when \\nreporting their identities.

When immigration policies limit access to \\npublic services for immigrants and their families, these restrictions lead to spillover effects \\non clinical diagnoses.

Pregnant women.‚ÄîDespite pregnancy being neither rare nor an illness, the \\nUnited States continues to experience rising maternal mortality and morbidity rates. In the \\nUnited States, the maternal mortality rate has more than doubled from 9.8 per 100,000 \\nlive births in 2000 to 21.5 in 2014 (79). Importantly, disclosure protocols recommend \\nsuppression of information in nationally available datasets when the number of cases or \\nevents in a data cell is low, in order to reduce the likelihood of a breach of confidentiality. \\nFor example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suppresses numbers for \\ncounties with fewer than 10 deaths for a given disease (80).

OUTCOME DEFINITION\\nThe next step in the model pipeline is to define the outcome of interest for a healthcare \\ntask. Even seemingly straightforward tasks like defining whether a patient has a disease \\ncan be skewed by how prevalent diseases are or how they manifest in some patient \\npopulations. For example, a model predicting if a patient will develop heart failure will \\nneed labeled examples both of patients who have heart failure and of patients without heart \\nfailure. Choosing these patients can rely on parts of the EHR that may be skewed due \\nto lack of access to care or due to abnormalities in clinical care: For example, economic \\nincentives may alter diagnosis code logging (81), clinical protocol affects the frequency \\nand observation of abnormal tests (62), historical racial mistrust may delay care and affect \\npatient outcomes (82), and naive data collection can yield inconsistent labels in chest X-rays \\n(56). Such biased labels, and the resulting models, may cause clinical practitioners to \\nallocate resources poorly.\\nDiagnosis code:\\na label in patient records of disease occurrence, which may be subject to \\nmisclassification, used primarily for billing purposes\\nWe discuss social justice considerations in two examples of commonly modeled healthcare \\noutcomes: clinical diagnosis and healthcare costs. In each example, it is essential that model \\ndevelopers choose a reliable proxy and account for noise in the outcome labels, as these \\nchoices can have a large impact on performance and equity of the resulting model.\\nChen et al.\\nPage 10\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

Clinical Diagnosis\\nClinical diagnosis is a fundamental task for clinical prediction models, e.g., models for \\ncomputer-aided diagnosis from medical imaging. In clinical settings, researchers often select \\npatient disease occurrence as the prediction label for models. However, there are many \\noptions for the choice of a disease occurrence label. For example, the outcome label for \\ndeveloping cardiovascular disease could be defined through the occurrence of specific \\nphrases in clinical notes. However, women can manifest symptoms of acute coronary \\nsyndrome differently (83) and receive delayed care as a result (84), which may then manifest \\nin diagnosis labels derived from the clinical notes being gender skewed. Because differences \\nin label noise result in disparities in model impact, researchers have the responsibility \\nto choose and improve disease labels so that these inequalities do not further exacerbate \\ndisparities in health.\\nLabel noise:\\nerrors or otherwise obscuring information that affects the quality of the labels\\nAdditionally, it is important to consider the healthcare system in which disease labels are \\nlogged. For example, healthcare providers leverage diagnosis codes for billing purposes, not \\nclinical research. As a result, diagnosis codes can create ambiguities because of overlap and \\nhierarchy in codes. Moreover, facilities have incentives to underreport (81) and overreport \\n(85, 86) outcomes, yielding differences in model representations.\\nRecent advances in improving disease labels target statistical corrections based on estimates \\nof the label noise. For instance, a positive label may be reliable, but the omission of a \\npositive label could indicate either a negative label (i.e., no disease) or merely a missed \\npositive label. Methods to address the positive-unlabeled setting use estimated noise rates \\n(87) or hand-curated labels from clinicians that are strongly correlated with positive labels, \\nknown also as silver-standard labels (88). Clinical analysis of sources of error in disease \\nlabels can also guide improvements (89) and identify affected groups (56).\\n4.2. Healthcare Costs\\nDevelopers of clinical models may choose to predict healthcare costs, meaning the ML \\nmodel seeks to predict which patients will cost the healthcare provider more in the future. \\nSome model developers may use healthcare costs as a proxy for future health needs to \\nguide accurate targeting of interventions (8), with the underlying assumption that addressing \\npatients with future health needs will limit future costs. Others may explicitly want to \\nunderstand patients who will have high healthcare costs to reduce the total cost of healthcare \\n(90). However, because socioeconomic factors affect both access to healthcare and access to \\nfinancial resources, these models may yield predictions that exacerbate inequities.\\nFor model developers seeking to optimize for health needs, healthcare costs can deviate \\nfrom health needs on an individual level because of patient socioeconomic factors. For \\ninstance, in a model used to allocate care management program slots to high-risk patients, \\nthe choice of future healthcare costs as a predictive outcome led to racial disparities in \\nChen et al.\\nPage 11\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\npatient allocation to the program (8). Healthcare costs can differ from health needs on an \\ninstitutional level due to under-insurance and undertreatment within the patient population \\n(91). After defining health disparities as all differences except those due to clinical need \\nand preferences, researchers have found racial disparities in mental healthcare. Specifically, \\nwhite patients had higher rates of initiation of treatment for mental health compared to \\nBlack and Hispanic or Latin(o/x) patients. Because the analysis controls for health needs, the \\ndisparities are solely a result of differences in healthcare access and systemic discrimination \\n(92).\\nAddressing issues that arise from the use of healthcare costs depends on the setting of the \\nML model. In cases where health need is of highest importance, a natural solution is to \\nchoose another outcome definition besides healthcare costs, e.g., the number of chronic \\ndiseases as a measure of health needs. If a model developer is most concerned with cost, it \\nis possible to correct for health disparities in predicting healthcare costs by building fairness \\nconsiderations directly into the predictive model objective function (93). Building these \\ntypes of algorithmic procedures is further discussed in Section 5.\\n5. ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT\\nAlgorithm development considers the construction of the underlying computation for the \\nML model and presents a major vulnerability and opportunity for ethical ML in healthcare. \\nJust as data are not neutral, algorithms are also not neutral. A disproportionate amount of \\npower lies with research teams that, after determining the research questions, make decisions \\nabout critical components of an algorithm such as the loss function (46, 94). In the case \\nof loss functions, common choices like the L1 absolute-error loss and L2 squared-error \\nloss do not target the same conditional functions of the outcome but instead minimize the \\nerror in the median and mean, respectively. Using a surrogate loss (e.g., hinge loss for the \\nerror rate) can provide computational efficiency, but it may not reflect the ethical criteria \\nthat we truly care about. Recent work has shown that models trained with a surrogate loss \\nmay exhibit approximation errors that disproportionately affect undersampled groups in \\nthe training data (95). Similarly, one might choose to optimize the worst-case error across \\ngroups as opposed to the average overall error. Such choices may seem purely technical but \\nreflect value statements about what should be optimized, potentially leading to differences in \\nperformance among marginalized groups (96).\\nLoss function:\\nthe relation that determines the error between algorithm output and a given label, which \\nthe algorithm uses to optimize\\nIn this section, we review several crucial factors in model development that potentially \\nimpact ethical deployment capacity: understanding (and accounting for) confounding, \\nfeature selection, tuning parameters, and the definition of ‚Äúfairness‚Äù itself.\\nChen et al.\\nPage 12\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

Understanding Confounding\\nDeveloping models that use sensitive attributes without a clear causal understanding of \\ntheir relationship to outcomes of interest can significantly affect model performance and \\ninterpretation. This is relevant to algorithmic problems focused on prediction, not just causal \\ninference. Confounding features‚Äîi.e., those features that influence both the independent \\nvariables and the dependent variable‚Äîrequire careful attention. The vast majority of models \\nlearn patterns based on observed correlations between training data, even when such \\ncorrelations do not occur in test data. For instance, recent work has demonstrated that \\nclassification models designed to detect hair color learn gender-biased decision boundaries \\nwhen trained on confounded data, i.e., if women are primarily blond in training data, the \\nmodel incorrectly associates gender with the hair label in test samples (97).\\nSensitive attribute:\\na specified patient feature (e.g., race, gender) that is considered important for fairness \\nconsiderations\\nTest data:\\nunseen information that a model predicts on and is evaluated against\\nAs ML methods are increasingly used for clinical decision support, it is critical to account \\nfor confounding features. In one canonical example, asthmatic patients presenting with \\npneumonia are given aggressive interventions that ultimately improve their chances of \\nsurvival over nonasthmatic patients (98). When the hospital protocol assigned additional \\ntreatment to patients with asthma, those patients had improved outcomes. Thus the treatment \\npolicy was a confounding factor in a seemingly straightforward prediction task by altering \\nthe data such that patients with asthma were erroneously predicted by models to have lower \\nrisk of dying from pneumonia.\\nSimply controlling for confounding features by including them as features in classification \\nor regression models may be insufficient to train reliable models because features can have a \\nmediating or moderating effect (posttreatment effect on outcomes of interest) and have to be \\nincorporated differently into model design (99).\\nChen et al.\\nPage 13\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nModern ML and causal discovery techniques can identify sources of confounding at scale \\n(100), although validation of such methods can be challenging because of the lack of \\ncounterfactual data. ML methods have also been proposed to estimate causal effects from \\nobservational data (101, 102). In practice, when potential hidden confounding is suspected, \\neither mediating features or proxies can be leveraged (99, 103) or sensitivity analysis \\nmethods can be used to determine potential sources of errors in effect estimates (104). \\nData-augmentation and sampling methods may also be used to mitigate effects of model \\nconfounding. For example, augmenting X-ray images with rotated and translated variants \\ncan help train a model that is not sensitive to orientation of an image (105).\\n5.2. Feature Selection\\nWith large-scale digitization of EHRs and other sources, sensitive attributes like race \\nand ethnicity may be increasingly available (although prone to misclassification and \\nmissingness). However, blindly incorporating factors like race and gender in a predictive \\nmodel may exacerbate inequities for a wide range of diagnostics and treatments (106). These \\nresulting inequities can lead to unintended and permanent embedding of biases in algorithms \\nused for clinical care. For example, vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) scores are used to \\npredict success of trial of labor of pregnant women with a prior cesarean section; however, \\nthese scores explicitly include a race component as an input, which reduces the chance of \\nVBAC success for Black and Hispanic women. Although researchers found that previous \\nobservational studies showed correlation between racial identity and success of trial of labor \\n(107), the underlying cause of this association is not well understood. Such naive inclusion \\nof race information could exacerbate disparities in maternal mortality. This ambiguity calls \\ninto question race-based correction in scores like VBAC (106).\\nAutomation in feature selection does not eliminate the need for contextual understanding. \\nFor example, stepwise regression is commonly used and taught as a technique for feature \\nselection despite known limitations (108). While specific methods have varying initialization \\n(e.g., start with an empty set of features or a full set of features) and processing steps \\n(e.g., deletion versus addition of features), most rely on p-values, R2, or other global fit \\nmetrics to select features. Weaknesses of stepwise regressions include the misleading nature \\nof p-values and the fact that the final set depends on if and when features were considered \\n(109). In ML, penalized regressions like lasso regression are popular for automated feature \\nselection, but the lasso trades potential increases in estimation bias for reductions in \\nvariance by shrinking some feature coefficients to zero. Features selected by lasso may \\nbe colinear with other features not selected (110). Over-interpretation of the selected features \\nin any automated procedures should therefore be avoided in practice given these pitfalls. \\nResearchers should also consider the humans-in-the-loop framework, whereby incorporation \\nof automated procedures is blended with investigator knowledge (111).\\nStepwise regression:\\na method of estimation whereby each feature is sequentially considered by addition or \\nsubtraction to the existing feature set\\nChen et al.\\nPage 14\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\n5.3. Tuning Parameters\\nThere are many tuning parameters that may be set a priori or selected via cross-validation \\n(110). These range from the learning rate in a neural network to the minimum size of \\nthe terminal leaves in a random forest. In the latter example, default settings in R for \\nclassification will allow trees to grow until there is just one observation in a terminal leaf. \\nThis can lead to overfitting the model to the training data and a loss of generalizability to \\nthe target population. Lack of generalizability is a central concern for ethical ML given the \\npreviously discussed issues in data collection and study inclusion. When data lack diversity \\nand are not representative of the target population where the model would be deployed, \\noverfitting algorithms to this data has the potential to disproportionately harm marginalized \\ngroups (112). Using cross-validation to select tuning parameters does not automatically \\nsolve these problems, as cross-validation still operates with respect to an a priori‚Äìchosen \\noptimization target.\\nGeneralizability:\\nthe ability of a model to apply in a setting different from the one in which it was trained\\n5.4. Performance Metrics\\nThere are many commonly used performance metrics for model evaluation, such as area \\nunder the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), area under the precision-recall \\ncurve (AUPRC), and calibration (113). However, the appropriate metrics to optimize depend \\non the intended use case and relative value of true positives, false positives, true negatives, \\nand false negatives. Not only can AUC be misleading when considering other global fit \\nmetrics (e.g., high AUC masking a weak true positive rate) but it also does not describe the \\nimpact of the model across selected groups. Furthermore, even so-called objective metrics \\nand scores can be deeply flawed and lead to over- or undertreatment of minorities if blindly \\napplied (114). Note that robust reporting of results should include an explicit statement of \\nother nonoptimized metrics, including the original intended use case, the training cohort and \\ncase, or the level of model uncertainty.\\nPerformance metric:\\nscore or other quantitative representation of a model‚Äôs quality and ability to achieve goals\\nAUC:\\na measure of the sensitivity and specificity of a model for each decision threshold\\nAUPRC:\\na measure of precision and recall of a model for each decision threshold\\nChen et al.\\nPage 15\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nCalibration:\\na measure of how well ML risk estimates reflect true risk\\n5.5. Group Fairness Definition\\nThe specific definition of fairness for a given application often impacts the choice of a \\nloss function, and therefore the underlying algorithm. Individual fairness imposes classifier \\nperformance requirements that operate over pairs of individuals; e.g., similar individuals \\nshould be treated similarly (115). Group fairness operates over protected groups (based on \\nsome sensitive attribute) by requiring that a classifier performance metric be balanced across \\nthose groups (116, 117). For instance, a model may be partially assessed by calculating \\nthe true positive rate separately among rural and urban populations to ensure risk score \\nsimilarity. Regressions subject to group fairness constraints or penalties optimizing toward \\njoint global and group fit considerations have also been developed (93, 118, 119).\\nGroup fairness:\\na principle whereby predefined patient groups should receive similar model performance\\nRecent work has focused on identifying and mitigating violations of fairness definitions \\nin healthcare settings. While most of these algorithms have emerged outside the field of \\nhealthcare, researchers have designed penalized and constrained regressions to improve \\nthe performance of health insurance plan payment. This payment system impacts tens \\nof millions of lives in the United States and is known to undercompensate insurers \\nfor individuals with certain health conditions, including mental health and substance \\nuse disorders, in part because billing codes do not accurately capture diagnoses \\n(120). Undercompensation creates incentives for insurers exclude individuals with these \\nhealth conditions from enrollment, limiting their access to care. Regressions subject \\nto group fairness constraints or penalties have been successful in removing nearly all \\nundercompensation for a single group with negligible impacts on global fit (93). Subsequent \\nwork incorporating multiple groups into the loss function also saw improvements in \\nundercompensation for the majority of groups not included (121).\\n6. POSTDEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS\\nOften the goal of model training is to ultimately deploy it in a clinical, epidemiological, \\nor policy service. However, deployed models can have lasting ethical impact beyond the \\nmodel performance measured in development: For example, in the inclusion of race in the \\nclinical risk scores described above that may lead to chronic over- or undertreatment (106). \\nHere we outline considerations for robust deployment by highlighting the need for careful \\nperformance reporting and auditing generalizability, documentation, and regulation.\\n6.1. Quantifying Impact\\nUnlike in other settings with high-stakes decisions (e.g., aviation), clinical staff performance \\nis not audited by an external body (122). Instead, clinicians are often a self-governing body, \\nChen et al.\\nPage 16\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nrelying on clinicians themselves to determine when a colleague is underperforming or in \\nbreach of ethical practice principles, e.g., through such tools as surgical morbidity and \\nmortality conferences (123). Clinical staff can also struggle to keep abreast of what current \\nbest practice recommendations are, as these can change dramatically over time; one study \\nfound that more than 400 previously routine practices were later contradicted in leading \\nclinical journals (124).\\nHence, it is important to measure and address the downstream impact of models \\nthough audits for bias and examination of clinical impact (6). Regular model auditing \\npostdeployment, i.e., detailed inspection of model performance on various groups and \\noutcomes, may reveal the impact of models on different populations (8) and identify areas \\nof potential concern. Some recent work has targeted causal models in dynamic systems in \\norder to reduce the severity of bias (125). Others have targeted bias reduction through model \\nconstruction with explicit guarantees about balanced performance (16) or by specifying \\ngroups that must have equal performance (126). Additionally, there is the possibility that \\nmodels may help to debias current clinical care by reducing known biases against minorities \\n(127) and disadvantaged majorities (128).\\nModel auditing:\\nthe postdeployment inspection of model performance on groups and outcomes\\n6.2. Model Generalizability\\nAs has been raised in previous sections, a crucial concern with model deployment is \\ngeneralization. Any shifts in data distributions can significantly impact model performance \\nwhen the settings for development and for deployment differ. For example, chest X-ray \\ndiagnosis models can have high performance on test data drawn from the same hospital \\nbut degrade rapidly on data from another hospital (129). Other work in gender bias on \\nchest X-ray data has demonstrated both that small proportions of female chest X-rays \\ndegrade diagnostic performance accuracy in female patients (130) and that this is not simply \\naddressed in all cases by adding in more female X-rays (131). Even within a single hospital, \\nmodels trained on data from an initial EHR system data deteriorated significantly when \\ntested on data from a new EHR system (132). Finally, data artifacts that induce strong priors \\nin what patterns ML models are sensitive to have the potential to perpetrate harms when \\nused without awareness (133). For example, patients with dark skin can have morphological \\nvariation and disease manifestations that are not easily detected under the defaults that are \\nset by predominantly white-skinned patients (134).\\nData artifact:\\na flaw in data caused by equipment, techniques, or conditions that is unrelated to model \\noutput\\nSeveral algorithms have recently been proposed to account for distribution shifts in \\ndata (135, 136). However, these algorithms have significant limitations, as they typically \\nChen et al.\\nPage 17\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nrequire assumptions about the nature or amount of distributional shift an algorithm can \\naccommodate. Some, like that of Reference 136, may require a clear indication of which \\ndistributions in a healthcare pipeline are expected to change, and may develop models for \\nprediction accordingly. Many of these assumptions may be verifiable. If not, periodically \\nmonitoring for data shifts (137) and potentially retraining models when performance \\ndeteriorates due to such shifts are imperative deployment considerations with significant \\nethical implications.\\n6.3. Model and Data Documentation\\nClear documentation enables insight into the model development and data collection. Good \\nmodel documentation should include clinically specific features of model development that \\ncan be assessed and recorded beforehand, such as logistics within the clinical setting, \\npotential unintended consequences, and trade-offs between bias and performance (138). In \\naddition to raising ethical concerns in the pipeline, the process of co-designing checklists \\nwith clinical practitioners formalizes ad hoc procedures and empowers individual advocates \\n(139). Standardized reporting of model performance‚Äîsuch as the one-page summary model \\ncards for model reporting (140)‚Äîcan empower clinical practitioners to understand model \\nlimitations and future model developers to identify areas of improvement. Similarly, better \\ndocumentation of the data supporting initial model training can help expose sources of \\ndiscrimination in the collected data. Modelers could use datasheets for datasets to detail the \\nconditions of data collection (141).\\n6.4. Regulation\\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) bears responsibility for the \\nregulation of healthcare ML models. As there does not exist comprehensive guidance for \\nhealthcare model research and subsequent deployment, the opportunity is ripe to create \\na comprehensive framework to audit and regulate models. Currently, the FDA‚Äôs proposed \\nML-specific modifications to the software as a medical device regulations draw a distinction \\nbetween models that are trained and then frozen prior to clinical deployment and models that \\ncontinue to learn on observed outcomes. Although models in the latter class can leverage \\nlarger, updated datasets, they also face additional risk due to model drift and may need \\nadditional audits (142). Such frameworks should explicitly account for health disparities \\nacross the stages of ML development in health and ensure health equity audits as part of \\npostmarket evaluation (143). We also note that there are many potential legal implications, \\ne.g., in malpractice and liability suits, that will require new solutions (144).\\nResearchers have proposed additional frameworks to guide clinical model development, \\nwhich could inspire future regulation. ML model regulation could draw from existing \\nregulatory frameworks: An RCT for ML models would assess patient benefit compared \\nto a control cohort of standard clinical practice (145), and a drug development pipeline for \\nML models would define a protocol for adverse events and model recalls (146). The clinical \\ninterventions accompanying the clinical ML model should be analyzed to contextualize the \\nuse of the model in the clinical setting (147).\\nChen et al.\\nPage 18\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\n7. RECOMMENDATIONS\\nIn this review, we have described the ethical considerations at each step of the ML model \\ndevelopment pipeline we introduced. While most researchers will address known challenges \\nsuch as deployed task accuracy and outcome distribution shift, they are unlikely to be aware \\nof the full magnitude of the hidden challenges such as existing health inequities or outcome \\nlabel bias. As seen in Figure 2, many hidden pipeline challenges can go unaddressed in a \\ntypical ML health project, but they have serious ethical repercussions. With these challenges \\nin mind, we propose five general recommendations that span the pipeline stages:\\n1.\\nProblems should be tackled by diverse teams and using frameworks that increase \\nthe probability that equity will be achieved. Further, historically understudied \\nproblems are important targets to practitioners looking to perform high-impact \\nwork.\\n2.\\nData collection should be framed as an important front-of-mind concern in \\nthe ML modeling pipeline, clear disclosures should be made about imbalanced \\ndatasets, and researchers should engage with domain experts to ensure that data \\nreflecting the needs of underserved and understudied populations are gathered.\\n3.\\nOutcome choice should reflect the task at hand and should preferably be \\nunbiased. If the outcome label has ethical bias, the source of inequity should be \\naccounted for in ML model design, leveraging literature that attempts to remove \\nethical biases during preprocessing, or with use of a reasonable proxy.\\n4.\\nReflection on the goals of the model is essential during development and should \\nbe articulated in a preanalysis plan. In addition to technical choices like loss \\nfunction, researchers must interrogate how, and whether, a model should be \\ndeveloped to best answer a research question, as well as what caveats are \\nincluded.\\n5.\\nAudits should be designed to identify specific harms and should be paired with \\nmethods and procedures. Harms should be examined group by group, rather \\nthan at a population level. ML ethical design checklists are one possible tool to \\nsystematically enumerate and consider such ethical concerns prior to declaring \\nsuccess in a project.\\nFinally, we note that ML also could and should be harnessed to create shifts in power \\nin health-care systems (148). This might mean actively selecting problems for the benefit \\nof underserved patients, designing methods to target systemic interventions for improved \\naccess to care and treatments, or enforcing evaluations with the explicit purpose of \\npreserving patient autonomy. In one salient example, the state of California reduced \\ndisparities in rates of obstetric hemorrhage (and therefore maternal mortality for women \\nof color) by weighing blood loss sponges, i.e., making access to treatment consistent and \\nunbiased for all women (149). Models could similarly be harnessed to learn and recommend \\nconsistent rules, potentially giving researchers an opportunity to debias current clinical \\ncare (150), measure racial disparities and mistrust in end-of-life care (82), and improve \\nknown biases against minorities (127) and disadvantaged majorities (128). Ultimately, \\nthe responsibility for ethical models and behavior lies with a broad community, but it \\nChen et al.\\nPage 19\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

Introduction\\\\nArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence includes approaches and techniques\\\\nlike machine learning, machine reasoning, and robotics. In\\\\nthis review, the main concern will be given towards machine\\\\nlearning as it is the approach that is being applied using\\\\ndiÔ¨Äerent techniques and algorithms in various healthcare\\\\nactivities. Te use of machine learning to solve clinical\\\\nproblems is called revolutionary clinical decision making.\\\\nWhen machine learning is being used in clinical decision\\\\nHindawi\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\nVolume 2021, Article ID 6679512, 20 pages\\\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6679512\\\\nmaking, it implies that the system will perceive a given\\\\nindividual by collecting and interpreting data relevant for\\\\nthe health of that individual and it will reason on the data to\\\\nsuggest the best actions that need to be performed to\\\\nmaintain or improve the individual‚Äôs health. In machine\\\\nlearning, the system needs to learn the context of the\\\\nproblem and the quality of data provided. Normally, these\\\\nalgorithms are not very strong and concrete at the beginning,\\\\nbut by performing a single and repetitive task, the algorithm\\\\nbecomes\\\\nstrong\\\\nwith\\\\nincreased\\\\nnumber\\\\nof\\\\nprevious\\\\nexperiences.\\\\nTere are two distinct ways that a clinical decision-\\\\nmaking solution interprets by comparing previous knowl-\\\\nedge that is included in the dataset. One is the fast or in-\\\\ntuitive approach which uses underlying clinical pattern\\\\nrecognition and is typically used in medical emergencies. But\\\\nthese have a higher possibility of being erroneous and\\\\nprovide incomplete perception. Te other approach is the\\\\nslow or reasoned method. It is deductive, deliberate, and\\\\nneeds greater intellectual, time, and cost information. But\\\\nthe decisions made are more accurate. As all these decisions\\\\nare based on the data that are being collected, analysed, and\\\\nstored in complex and heterogeneous forms, it is important\\\\nto use algorithmic approaches to minimize the computing\\\\npower required. Machine learning applications have cur-\\\\nrently contributed massively to the healthcare sector\\\\nworldwide to improve its quality and will continue to do so\\\\n[1].\\\\nIt is also important to mention that when discussing\\\\ncomputational decision making in the healthcare sector, it is\\\\nnot always about detecting or predicting diseases, bio-\\\\nmedicine, biomedical image analysis, etc., but also about\\\\nhow to perform medical treatment research, patient care,\\\\nallocating resources, managing hospital volume, public\\\\nhealth policymaking, and much more. As an example, when\\\\nconsidering the current situation that has arisen with\\\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, it could be seen that all the afore-\\\\nmentioned points need to be considered in healthcare and\\\\nthose tasks need to be performed within a considerably small\\\\ntime period. Terefore, the best approach is to use machine\\\\nlearning-based decision making in the healthcare sector in\\\\nsuch times. Tis is the reason why there is a demand for the\\\\narea ‚Äúemergency machine learning‚Äù in the present world [2].\\\\nEven though artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence is set to make trans-\\\\nformation by playing an important role in healthcare, there\\\\nare a few ethical aspects as well that need to be considered\\\\nwhen implementing such systems and obtaining decisions\\\\nfrom them. Few of the ethical issues are the accountability\\\\nand transparency of the decisions made by such systems, the\\\\npotential for group harms arising from algorithmic bias and\\\\nthe professional roles, and the integrity of the clinicians.\\\\nTerefore, it is important to give consideration when\\\\nimplementing such systems and balance them with the\\\\nbeneÔ¨Åt that they create with more eÔ¨Écient healthcare sys-\\\\ntems by the high and accurate computational power of\\\\nartiÔ¨Åcial intelligence at a considerably low cost. Moreover,\\\\nalgorithms in artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence have the capacity to\\\\nperform computerized predictive analysis by Ô¨Åltering, or-\\\\ndering, and searching for patterns from big datasets from\\\\nmultiple sources to provide fast and informed decisions. In\\\\nthe present context, due to this discussed matter, most ju-\\\\nrisdictions do not allow directly applying these algorithms to\\\\nmake the Ô¨Ånal decisions, but instead use them as an aid for\\\\ndiagnosis [3].\\\\nTroughout the paper many machine learning algo-\\\\nrithms and their applications in the Ô¨Åeld of computational\\\\ndecision making for healthcare will be discussed along with\\\\nthe methods that are used to improve the eÔ¨Éciency of the\\\\nalgorithms with the objective to highlight the importance of\\\\nscalable machine learning algorithms in healthcare appli-\\\\ncations. Te aim of the paper is to discuss the involvement of\\\\nmachine learning algorithms in the healthcare sector to\\\\nperform computational decision making starting from the\\\\ninitial phase where machine learning was introduced to\\\\ncomputational biology till the peak it currently stands which\\\\nis the introduction of precision medicine to the Ô¨Åeld of\\\\nbiomedicine. Tis paper is organized in diÔ¨Äerent sections.\\\\nMachine learning approaches and algorithms that are being\\\\napplied in healthcare for decision making will be discussed\\\\nin Section 2 followed by the applications of machine learning\\\\nin the healthcare sector in various aspects such as disease\\\\nprediction\\\\nand\\\\ndetection,\\\\nmedical\\\\nimaging,\\\\nmachine\\\\nlearning in biomedicine, biomedical event extraction, ma-\\\\nchine learning approaches to polypharmacology, and ma-\\\\nchine learning for drug repurposing using system biology.\\\\nTe discussion section will include an evaluation and\\\\ncomparison of machine learning algorithms with regard to\\\\nthe applications of these algorithms in healthcare which will\\\\nbe followed by recognition of diÔ¨Äerent mechanisms used to\\\\nenhance the accuracy of the algorithms within applications,\\\\nalong with further information on the involvement of\\\\nscalable machine learning algorithms for computational\\\\ndecision making in healthcare. Te latter part of the paper\\\\nconsists of the conclusion.\\\\n2. Machine Learning Approaches\\\\nand Algorithms\\\\nMachine learning can be introduced as a scientiÔ¨Åc discipline\\\\nthat focuses on how computers learn from data and con-\\\\ntinuously improve themselves. It is mainly based on prob-\\\\nability and statistics. But it is more powerful than the\\\\nstandard statistical methodologies when it comes to decision\\\\nmaking. Information gathered from a dataset which is being\\\\ngiven to the algorithm is called features. Te accuracy of the\\\\npredictions made by the model is dependent on the quality\\\\nof the features provided to the algorithm. It is the duty of a\\\\nmachine learning developer to detect the subset of features\\\\nthat could best Ô¨Åt the purpose, increasing the accuracy of the\\\\nmodel. Tis is not an easy task. Continuous experiments\\\\nshould be carried out to identify the said feature subset for\\\\nthe algorithm. When considering putting a machine\\\\nlearning algorithm to applications, there are basically three\\\\nsteps to follow, which are training, testing, and validation.\\\\nTraining is important as the accuracy of the results will be\\\\ndepending on the training dataset. Using the test dataset, the\\\\nperformance of the algorithm will be measured. When using\\\\nthe test data for measuring the performance, it is also\\\\n2\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\nimportant to lower the bias and to increase the variance in\\\\nthis testing period. A good machine learning algorithm must\\\\noptimize the bias-variance trade-oÔ¨Ä. Te evaluation of the\\\\nÔ¨Ånal machine learning algorithm performance is done based\\\\non the validation dataset in the validation period [4]. As a\\\\nstart, it would be better to have an idea about various ap-\\\\nproaches taken in machine learning along with several al-\\\\ngorithms that are being used excessively for clustering and\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åcation purposes in machine learning.\\\\n2.1. Supervised Learning. In supervised learning, a training\\\\nset is provided with appropriate objectives in this approach.\\\\nClassiÔ¨Åcation and regression are the two categories found in\\\\nsupervised learning. In classiÔ¨Åcation, with the use of clas-\\\\nsiÔ¨Åcation methods, the trained system allocates inputs into\\\\nclasses. In regression, the sources are continuous rather than\\\\ndiscrete. Te root-mean-squared error is being used to\\\\nevaluate regression predictions, while accuracy is being used\\\\nto\\\\nevaluate\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åcation\\\\npredictions.\\\\n[5].\\\\nSupervised\\\\nlearning has the goal of predicting a known output based on\\\\na common dataset. Tasks performed by supervised learning\\\\ncan most of the time be performed by a trained person as\\\\nwell. Supervised learning focuses on classiÔ¨Åcation which\\\\ninvolves choosing among subgroups to best describe a new\\\\ninstance of data and prediction, which involves estimating\\\\nan unknown parameter. Tis is often used to estimate and\\\\nmodel risk while Ô¨Ånding relationships which are not readily\\\\nvisible to humans [6]. Below are a few supervised learning\\\\nalgorithms which are widely used in the Ô¨Åeld of computa-\\\\ntional biology and biomedicine.\\\\n2.1.1. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN). KNN is a popular su-\\\\npervised classiÔ¨Åcation algorithm which is used in many Ô¨Åelds\\\\nsuch as pattern recognition, intrusion detection, and so on.\\\\nKNN is a simple algorithm which is easy to understand. Even\\\\nthe accuracy is high in KNN, but the issues are that it is\\\\ncomputationally expensive and it has a high memory re-\\\\nquirement as both testing and training data need to be stored\\\\n[7]. A prediction for a new instance is obtained by Ô¨Ånding\\\\nthe most similar instances at Ô¨Årst and then summarizing the\\\\noutput variable according to those similar instances. For\\\\nregression, this can be the mean value, and for classiÔ¨Åcation,\\\\nthis may be the mode value. To determine the similar in-\\\\nstance, the distance measure is used. Euclidean distance is\\\\nthe most popular approach used to calculate the distance.\\\\nTe training dataset should be vectors in a multidimensional\\\\nfeature space, each with a class label [5].\\\\n2.1.2. Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a supervised\\\\nmachine learning algorithm which is used to address mainly\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åcation problems but also used for regression issues. In\\\\nthis algorithm, initially, the data items are plotted as points\\\\nin an n-dimensional space with the feature value being the\\\\nparticular coordinate. Ten, it identiÔ¨Åes the hyperplane that\\\\nseparates the datapoints into two classes. By this, the\\\\nmarginal distance between the decision hyperplane and\\\\ninstances that are close to the boundary can be maximized\\\\n[5].What brings SVM ahead of other algorithms is that it has\\\\nbasic functions that can map points to other dimensions by\\\\nusing nonlinear relationships [8]. As it divides the data-\\\\npoints to two classes, SVM is also known as the non-\\\\nprobabilistic binary classiÔ¨Åer. SVM has more accuracy when\\\\ncompared with many other algorithms. But it is best suited\\\\nfor problems with small datasets. Te reason is that when the\\\\ndataset keeps on getting larger, the training becomes more\\\\ncomplex and time consuming. When data have noise, it\\\\ncannot perform well. To make the classiÔ¨Åcation more eÔ¨É-\\\\ncient, SVM uses a subset of training points. SVM is capable\\\\nof solving both linear and nonlinear problems, but nonlinear\\\\nSVM is preferred over linear SVM as it has better perfor-\\\\nmance [7].\\\\n2.1.3. Decision Trees (DTs). DT is a supervised algorithm\\\\nwhich has a tree like model where decisions, possible\\\\nconsequences, and their outcomes are being considered.\\\\nEach node carries a question, and each branch represents an\\\\noutcome. Te leaf nodes are class labels. When a leaf node is\\\\nbeing reached by a sample data, the label of the corre-\\\\nsponding node will be assigned to the sample. Tis approach\\\\nis suited when the problem is simple and when the dataset is\\\\nsmall. Even though the algorithm is easy to understand, it\\\\nhas certain issues such as the overÔ¨Åtting problem and biased\\\\noutcomes when working with imbalanced datasets. But DTis\\\\ncapable of mapping both linear and nonlinear relationships\\\\n[7].\\\\n2.1.4. ClassiÔ¨Åcation and Regression Trees (CARTs). CART is\\\\na predictive model from which the output value is predicted\\\\nbased on the existing values in the constructed tree. Te\\\\nrepresentation for the CARTmodel is a binary tree in which\\\\neach root represents a single input and a split point on that\\\\nvariable. Leaf nodes contain an output which is used to make\\\\npredictions [5].\\\\n2.1.5. Logistic Regression (LR). LR is a popular mathematical\\\\nmodelling procedure which is used for epidemiologic\\\\ndatasets in the area of machine learning. It Ô¨Årst calculates\\\\nusing the logistic function. Ten, it learns the coeÔ¨Écients for\\\\nthe logistic regression model and then Ô¨Ånally makes pre-\\\\ndictions using that logistic regression model [9]. Tis model\\\\nis a generalized linear model and has two parts, namely,\\\\nlinear part and link function. Te linear part is responsible\\\\nfor carrying out the calculations of the classiÔ¨Åcation model,\\\\nand the link function is responsible for delivering the output\\\\nof the calculation [10]. LR is a supervised machine learning\\\\nalgorithm which needs a hypothesis and a cost function. It is\\\\nto be noted that optimizing the cost function is important\\\\n[11].\\\\n2.1.6. Random Forest Algorithm (RFA). RFA is a trending\\\\nmachine learning technique which is capable of both re-\\\\ngression and classiÔ¨Åcation [12]. It is a supervised learning\\\\nalgorithm in which the ground methodology is recursion. In\\\\nthis algorithm, a group of decision trees are being created\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\n3\\\\nand the bagging method is used for training purposes [13].\\\\nRFA is insensitive to noise and can be used for imbalanced\\\\ndatasets. Te problem of overÔ¨Åtting is also not prominent in\\\\nRFA [7].\\\\n2.1.7. Naive Bayes (NB). NB is a classiÔ¨Åcation algorithm\\\\nwhich is used for binary and multiclass problems. Te NB\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åers are a collection of classifying algorithms that are\\\\nbased on the Bayes theorem. But they all adhere to a\\\\ncommon principle which is every pair of features being\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åed must be independent of each other [5]. Tis is a bit\\\\nsimilar to SVM, but the process takes advantage from sta-\\\\ntistical methods. In this method, when there is a new input,\\\\nthe probabilistic value will be calculated among the classes\\\\nwith regard to the given input and the data will be labelled\\\\nwith the class which has the highest probabilistic value for\\\\nthe given input [9].\\\\n2.1.8. ArtiÔ¨Åcial Neural Network (ANN). ANN is a supervised\\\\nmachine learning approach which is well known for image\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åcation problems. In machine learning, artiÔ¨Åcial\\\\nneurons are considered to be the basic concept of ANN and\\\\nit is similar to a biological neural network. Tere are 3 layers\\\\nin an ANN, and every node in each layer is connected with\\\\nall the nodes in the other layers. By increasing the number of\\\\nhidden layers, a deeper neural network can be created [14].\\\\nIn neural networks, there are three types of functions. Error\\\\nfunction will determine how good or bad the output was for\\\\na given set of inputs. Te search function will identify the\\\\nchanges that would reduce the error function. Update\\\\nfunction will determine how the changes will be made as per\\\\nthe search function. Tis is an iterative process that would\\\\nimprove the performance of the algorithm [8].\\\\n2.2.UnsupervisedLearning. When a developer does not have\\\\na clear understanding of the data that are involved with the\\\\nsystem, it is not possible to label the data and provide them\\\\nas the training dataset. In these cases, the machine learning\\\\nalgorithms themselves can be used to detect similarities and\\\\ndiÔ¨Äerences between the data objects. Tis is the unsupervised\\\\napproach of machine learning. In this method, existing\\\\npatterns will be identiÔ¨Åed and the data will be clustered\\\\naccording to the identiÔ¨Åed patterns [4]. Terefore, in un-\\\\nsupervised learning, the system makes decisions without\\\\nbeing trained by a dataset as no labelled data are being given\\\\nto the system which could be used for predictions [5]. It is to\\\\nbe noted that unsupervised learning is an attempt to Ô¨Ånd\\\\nnaturally occurring patterns or groups within data. Te\\\\nchallenging part in it is to Ô¨Ånd whether the recognized\\\\npatterns or groups are useful in some way. Tis is the reason\\\\nfor unsupervised learning to play a major role in precision\\\\nmedicine. As a simple example, when grouping individuals\\\\naccording to their genetics, environment, and medical\\\\nhistory, certain relationships among them which were not\\\\nvisible before might get identiÔ¨Åed by unsupervised machine\\\\nlearning algorithms [6]. K-means, mean shift, aÔ¨Énity\\\\npropagation, density-based spatial clustering of applications\\\\nwith noise (DBSCAN), Gaussian mixture modelling, Mar-\\\\nkov random Ô¨Åelds, iterative self-organizing data (ISO-\\\\nDATA), and fuzzy C-means systems are a few examples for\\\\nunsupervised algorithms [8].\\\\nClustering is an approach in unsupervised learning, and\\\\nit can be used for dividing inputs into clusters. But these\\\\nclusters are not identiÔ¨Åed initially but are grouped based on\\\\nresemblance [5]. In clustering, the root approaches are\\\\nseparated as per the diÔ¨Äerent features that they carry. Tey\\\\ncan be partitioning (k-means), hierarchical, grid-based,\\\\ndensity-based, or model-based, and they can be further\\\\ndivided as numerical, discrete, and mixed data types. In-\\\\nheritance relationships between clustering algorithms within\\\\nan approach show common features and improvements that\\\\nthey make on each other. Speed, minimal parameters, ro-\\\\nbustness to noise, outliers, redundancy handling, and object\\\\norder independence are the desired clustering features which\\\\nare required in a clustering algorithm to be implemented\\\\nwithin a biomedical application [15]. Clustering algorithms\\\\nare used when datasets are too large and complex for manual\\\\nanalysis. Terefore, they must be fast and they must not be\\\\naÔ¨Äected by redundant sequences. It is important to evaluate a\\\\nclustering algorithm to know whether it is suitable for the\\\\nproblem in hand by considering features such as\\\\n(1) Scalability: runtime\\\\nand\\\\nmemory\\\\nrequirements\\\\nshould not exceed when working with large datasets.\\\\n(2) Robustness: ability to detect outliers that are diÔ¨Äerent\\\\nfrom the rest of the samples.\\\\n(3) Order insensitivity: the order that the inputs are\\\\ngiven should not be aÔ¨Äecting the Ô¨Ånal output.\\\\n(4) Minimum\\\\nuser-speciÔ¨Åed\\\\ninput:\\\\nthe\\\\nminimum\\\\nnumber of parameters that should be provided.\\\\n(5) Mixed data types: the objects provided may have\\\\ndiÔ¨Äerent data types.\\\\n(6) Arbitrary-shaped cluster: ability to Ô¨Ånd arbitrary-\\\\nshaped clusters.\\\\n(7) Point proportion admissibility: duplicating objects\\\\nand reclustering should not change the result [15].\\\\nWhen giving concern to the above factors, it is to be\\\\nnoted that as a result of the use of unsupervised machine\\\\nlearning in healthcare, when a patient is being diagnosed for\\\\na speciÔ¨Åc disease, in that process itself the patient will be\\\\nidentiÔ¨Åed of another disease as well if any such disease is\\\\npresent. Te reason is that the algorithm has learnt itself on\\\\nfacts that need to be considered for various types of diseases\\\\nand it analyses the given data and categorizes as diseases\\\\naccording to those data. In addition, even though various\\\\nreports taken to identify diseases may include diÔ¨Äerent types\\\\nof data, using this approach, all these data can be analysed\\\\nsimultaneously which is of much convenience and also time\\\\nsaving. With regard to the aforementioned aspects, there is\\\\nno doubt that healthcare decision making is highly beneÔ¨Åted\\\\nfrom the unsupervised machine learning approach.\\\\n2.2.1. Partition Clustering. In partition clustering, the ob-\\\\njects are partitioned and may change clusters based on the\\\\n4\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\ndissimilarity. It is useful in bioinformatics when the number\\\\nof clusters is decided such as for a small gene expression\\\\ndataset. Te drawback is that the user needs to manually\\\\nenter the number of clusters as an input. But this approach is\\\\ncommonly\\\\nused\\\\nin\\\\nbioinformatics.\\\\nFuzzy\\\\nk-means,\\\\nCOOLCAT, clustering large applications (CLARA), and\\\\nclustering large applications based on randomized search\\\\n(CLARANS) are a few examples for partition clustering\\\\nalgorithms [15].\\\\n2.2.2. Graph-Based Clustering. Graph-based clustering is\\\\nused in interactomes to make complex predictions and to\\\\nsequence networks. Tis approach is often slow and sensitive\\\\nto user-speciÔ¨Åed parameters. super-paramagnetic clustering\\\\n(SPC), Markov cluster algorithm (MCL), molecular complex\\\\ndetection (MCODE), and restricted neighbourhood search\\\\ncluster (RNSC) are a few examples for graph-based clus-\\\\ntering algorithms [15].\\\\n2.2.3. Hierarchical Clustering. In hierarchical clustering, the\\\\nobjects are partitioned into a tree of nodes and these nodes\\\\nare considered as clusters. Tere are parent nodes and child\\\\nnodes. A node could have just one parent, and each node can\\\\nhave zero or more child nodes. Tis approach is popular in\\\\nbioinformatics as clusters can be navigated at various levels\\\\nof granularity. Te drawbacks are that they are often slow,\\\\nerrors made when merging clusters cannot be undone even\\\\nthough it aÔ¨Äects the result, and if large clusters are merged,\\\\nthen interesting local cluster structure may be lost. Tis\\\\napproach is used to represent protein sequence family re-\\\\nlationships and also could be used to show gene relations\\\\nreÔ¨Çecting their gene similarity. Chameleon, robust clustering\\\\nusing\\\\nlinks\\\\n(ROCK),\\\\nscalable\\\\ninformation\\\\nbottleneck\\\\n(LIMBO), and spectral are a few examples for hierarchical\\\\nclustering algorithms [15].\\\\n2.2.4. Density-Based Clustering. Density-based clustering\\\\nuses a local density criterion, and the clusters are subspaces\\\\nin which the objects are dense and are separated by sub-\\\\nspaces of low density. It is used in bioinformatics to Ô¨Ånd the\\\\ndensest subspaces in interactome networks, typically in-\\\\nvolving cliques. Time eÔ¨Éciency and the ability to Ô¨Ånd\\\\nclusters of arbitrary shapes are the advantages of this ap-\\\\nproach. Some of these algorithms accept user parameters,\\\\nbut it is not the number of clusters. Ordering points to\\\\nidentify the clustering structure (OPTICS), clustering in\\\\nquest (CLIQUE), density based clustering (DENCLUE), and\\\\nclustering categorical data using summaries (CACTUS) are a\\\\nfew examples for density-based clustering algorithms [15].\\\\n2.2.5. Model-Based Clustering. In model-based clustering, it\\\\nis assumed that objects match a model which is often a\\\\nstatistical distribution. Te model can be user speciÔ¨Åed using\\\\na parameter, and this model can even be changed in the\\\\nprocess. Tis approach can be found in bioinformatics to\\\\nintegrate background knowledge into gene expressions,\\\\ninteractomes, and sequences. Slow processing time on large\\\\ndatasets is a drawback of this method. If the user assump-\\\\ntions are false when deÔ¨Åning the models, then the results will\\\\nalso be inaccurate. SVM-based clustering, COBWEB, and\\\\nAutoClass are a few model-based clustering algorithms [15].\\\\n2.3.SemisupervisedLearning. For semisupervised learning, a\\\\npartial training set of data is provided. Tis type of training is\\\\nused when some missing results could be targeted by some\\\\ntraining data. Semisupervised learning algorithms are\\\\ntrained on both labelled and unlabelled data. Due to this\\\\nreason, it exhibits the features of both supervised and un-\\\\nsupervised machine learning algorithms [16].\\\\n2.4. Evolutionary Learning. Evolutionary learning is mainly\\\\nused in the biology Ô¨Åeld to learn about biological organisms\\\\nand predict their survival rate. Using this method, the level\\\\nof correctness of a result can also be predicted [16].\\\\n2.5. Active Learning. In active learning, the system gets the\\\\ntraining tags only for a restricted set of occurrences. By using\\\\nit, the optimality of the substances can be enhanced to gain\\\\ntags for the required goal. Te advantage in this approach is\\\\nthat the algorithm not only continuously learns but also gets\\\\nthe facts which were self-learnt approved either by querying\\\\na user or an information source in an interactive manner. It\\\\nis something similar to budget functions in an organization\\\\nand is a modern machine learning approach for decision\\\\nmaking [16].\\\\n2.6. Deep Learning. Deep learning is an advanced phase of\\\\nmachine learning which evolves around neural networks for\\\\nlearning and predicting data. Using this approach, complex\\\\ngeneralized systems can be implemented which are able to\\\\naccept any type of problem and give predictions regarding it\\\\n[16].\\\\n2.7. Reinforcement Learning. In reinforcement learning, the\\\\ntraining data are provided only as a response to the pro-\\\\ngram‚Äôs activities in a self-motivated situation. It has a\\\\ncontinuous learning process from the environment in an\\\\niterative fashion [13].\\\\nAfter discussing several machine learning approaches, it\\\\nwould be better to list down a few examples on the appli-\\\\ncations of machine learning in the Ô¨Åeld of biomedicine so\\\\nthat this review will be interesting from the very beginning.\\\\nIn neuroscience, machine learning classiÔ¨Åers are being used\\\\nto study functional and structural dynamics of the brain.\\\\nMachine learning approaches are used in cancer prediction\\\\nand prognosis. SVM classiÔ¨Åers are used to detect prostate\\\\ncancer. Hierarchical clustering has been used in investiga-\\\\ntion of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. ANN has been used in classi-\\\\nfying diÔ¨Äerent subtypes of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures\\\\n[4]. With the knowledge gathered on various machine\\\\nlearning approaches and machine learning algorithms which\\\\nare mostly connected with computational biology and\\\\nbiomedicine, now it is time to dive into deeper knowledge\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\n5\\\\nand to identify the applications of these algorithms in the\\\\ndiscussing Ô¨Åeld.\\\\n3. Machine Learning in Disease Prediction\\\\nand Detection\\\\nVarious machine learning approaches have been imple-\\\\nmented to predict or detect a disease at its early stages so that\\\\nthe treatment for it would be less complex and it would\\\\nincrease the probability of the patient being cured. As a\\\\nresult of these approaches, diÔ¨Äerent types of diseases have\\\\nbeen detected but with diverse accuracy levels depending on\\\\nfactors such as the used algorithm, feature set, training\\\\ndataset, and so on. In this section, a few selected diseases will\\\\nbe discussed as examples, along with the importance of\\\\nidentifying a disease at the earliest, the machine learning\\\\nmethods implemented to detect the disease, and the features\\\\nthat were considered to make predictions. A descriptive\\\\ncomparison of the machine learning approaches which have\\\\nbeen implemented will be conducted in the discussion\\\\nsection of the paper, followed by suggestions to further\\\\nimprove them.\\\\n3.1.Cancer. Human body has the right count of cells of each\\\\ntype. Cancer begins with abrupt changes in the cell orga-\\\\nnization. Signals which are being generated by cells deter-\\\\nmine the control and division of cells. When these signals\\\\nbecome faulty, cells multiply too much which form a lump\\\\ncalled tumour. Nowadays, thermography is more reliable as\\\\nit is noninvasive and nonionizing. With the emerging\\\\ntechnology, it has been producing eÔ¨Écient and positive\\\\nresults which have made it superior over other technologies.\\\\nFrom the thermographic images, with the use of feature\\\\nextraction techniques and machine learning techniques, the\\\\npresence of cancer cells can be detected. Scale invariant\\\\nfeature transform (SIFT) and speeded up robust feature\\\\n(SURF) techniques can be used to extract features from\\\\nimages. Using principal component analysis (PCA), the\\\\nfeatures could be further Ô¨Åltered in order to make better\\\\ninterpretations [7].\\\\n3.1.1. Breast Cancer. Breast cancer is a type of cancer that is\\\\nmostly seen in women and is a leading cause for women‚Äôs\\\\ndeath. But this can be reduced by early detection of can-\\\\ncerous cells by tests like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),\\\\nmammogram, ultrasound, and biopsy. Breast cancer is di-\\\\nagnosed by classifying the tumour. Tumours can be either\\\\nbenign or malignant. It is to be noted that malignant tu-\\\\nmours are more harmful than benign tumours. But it is not\\\\nan easy task for physicians to distinguish among these tu-\\\\nmours. Tis makes machine learning algorithms important\\\\nas they can automatically learn and improve from the ex-\\\\nperiences without being explicitly programmed [5].\\\\nIn the past years, many machine learning techniques\\\\nwere developed for breast cancer detection and classiÔ¨Åca-\\\\ntion. Teir process could be analysed in three stages which\\\\nare preprocessing, feature extraction, and classiÔ¨Åcation.\\\\nFeature extraction stage is important as it helps in\\\\ndiscriminating between benign and malignant tumours.\\\\nTen, the image properties such as smoothness, coarseness,\\\\ndepth, and regularity are extracted using segmentation [17].\\\\nNormally, images are converted to binary to extract\\\\nuseful information. But it has been observed that once doing\\\\nso, some important features in the image vanished which\\\\nomits crucial information. Tis has led to keeping the images\\\\nin the grey scale format. Using discrete wavelet transfor-\\\\nmation (DWT), the images can be transformed from the\\\\ntime domain to the frequency domain. Tis wavelet de-\\\\ncomposition contains four matrices which are the approx-\\\\nimation coeÔ¨Écient matrix, the horizontal detailed coeÔ¨Écient\\\\nmatrix, the vertical detailed coeÔ¨Écient matrix, and the di-\\\\nagonal detailed coeÔ¨Écient matrix. Tese are the values that\\\\nwill be used for the machine learning algorithms [11].\\\\n3.1.2. Lung Cancer. Lung cancer can initiate in the wind-\\\\npipe, main airway, or lungs. People with emphysema and\\\\nprevious chest problems have a higher probability of being\\\\ndiagnosed with lung cancer. Tobacco, smoking, and air\\\\npollution can be a few major risk factors for lung cancer.\\\\nLung cancer starts in the lungs at the primary stage and\\\\nspreads to other organs as the secondary stage. Symptoms of\\\\nlung cancer will not be shown until the disease is quite\\\\nadvanced. Tat is what makes it more dangerous [9].\\\\nComputerized tomography (CT) reports are less noisy as\\\\ncompared to MRI and X-ray reports. Grayscale conversion,\\\\nnoise reduction, binarization, and segmentation techniques\\\\nare important to get the image in the required form with less\\\\nnoise and distortion. When converting to grey scale, the\\\\naverage of RGB is taken. Te median Ô¨Ålter is used for noise\\\\nreduction. Segmentation removes unnecessary details from\\\\nthe images and locates the objects and the boundaries. In\\\\nfeature extraction stage, features such as area, perimeter, and\\\\neccentricity are considered [18].\\\\nSmall-cell lung cancer (SCLC) detection is extremely\\\\ndiÔ¨Écult for human as it is almost identical to the one\\\\nwithout. Tis is where the machine learning algorithms\\\\nsuch as convolution neural network- (CNN-) based deep\\\\nlearning methods could be used in detecting SCLC.\\\\nUsually, deep learning algorithms require large training\\\\ndatasets which is an issue. Entropy degradation method\\\\n(EDM) can be used to overcome the said matter. Te\\\\ntraining data and testing data need to be high-resolution\\\\nlung CTscans. EDM carries the concept of shallow neural\\\\nnetwork where vectorized histograms are converted to\\\\nscores. Ten, the scores are transformed to probability\\\\nusing logistic function. In this approach, SCLC detection\\\\nis considered as a binomial problem which contains only\\\\ntwo groups: either a healthy person or a lung cancer\\\\npatient. So, initially test data are also given with both\\\\nthese types. Tis approach is reasonably accurate but not\\\\nthe best, and there is a large space to be further improved.\\\\nBut it is recommended that it could be further improved\\\\nby providing a larger training set and a deeper network.\\\\nBy combining with CNN, the image processing is also\\\\nfurther improved for better detection as CNN is being\\\\nused in many applications of CT imaging [19].\\\\n6\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\n3.1.3. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia. Acute lymphoblastic\\\\nleukaemia (ALL) is a type of cancer where a large number of\\\\nimmature lymphocyte blood cells develop and they aÔ¨Äect the\\\\nproduction of other blood cells. Tis progresses rapidly and\\\\ncan be very fatal within a month or a week. Pale colour of\\\\nskin, patient feeling very tired, lymph node getting enlarged,\\\\nfever, and joint pain are a few symptoms that were identiÔ¨Åed\\\\nin the patients who were diagnosed with ALL. Machine\\\\nlearning algorithms play a vital role when trying to auto-\\\\nmatically segment and classify microscopic images to detect\\\\nleukaemia.\\\\nTere have been various machine learning algorithms\\\\nused for leukaemia detection such as KNN, SVM, NB, radial\\\\nbasis function network (RBFN), and multilayer perceptron\\\\n(MLP). But in all these approaches, there are basically four\\\\nsections which are preprocessing, feature extraction, clas-\\\\nsiÔ¨Åcation model building, and evaluation of the classiÔ¨Åer. In\\\\nthe preprocessing stage, cropping of the image will be done\\\\nso that the region of interest (ROI) is clearly visible and the\\\\nunwanted information is eliminated. Using the Gaussian\\\\nblur smoothing technique, the images can be further pro-\\\\ncessed to enhance the picture by reducing the noise. In the\\\\nfeature extraction stage, concern is given towards colour-\\\\nbased features, geometrical features, statistical features,\\\\nHaralick texture feature, image moments, local binary\\\\npattern, and presence of adjacent cells [20].\\\\n3.2. Diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic disease, and it needs to\\\\nbe identiÔ¨Åed at the early stages for correct medication.\\\\nDiabetes is caused when the sugar ratio in blood increases.\\\\nTis makes the life complicated for the patients due to many\\\\nreasons. Diabetes can be classiÔ¨Åed under three types, namely,\\\\ndiabetes 1, diabetes 2, and gestation diabetes.\\\\nDiscriminant analysis (DA) is a procedure in which the\\\\nclass label of an input is determined by a series of equations\\\\nthat are obtained by input features. Normally, DA uses two\\\\npossible objectives which are Ô¨Ånding a related equation for\\\\nclassifying test samples and interpretation of the predictive\\\\nequation to better understand the relationship among fea-\\\\ntures. Being pregnant, the weight of the patient, blood\\\\npressure, glucose concentration, the ratio of insulin in blood,\\\\ndiabetes pedigree function (DPF), skinfold thickness, and\\\\npatient age are some features which can be considered for\\\\nthe classiÔ¨Åcation [10].\\\\nBy using machine learning algorithms such as Gaussian\\\\nNaive Bayes (GNB), LR, KNN, CART, RFA, and SVM along\\\\nwith variables in electronic medical records (EMRs) such as\\\\nserum-glucose1, serum-glucose2 levels, body mass index\\\\n(BMI), age, race, gender, creatinine level, and so on, pre-\\\\ndiction of type 2 diabetics was possible [21]. Time to time\\\\nvarious machine learning techniques were used to try and\\\\nimprove the accuracy of the predictions made. One ap-\\\\nproach was made using neural networks. In this method, a\\\\nfeed-forward neural network was trained by a back-\\\\npropagation algorithm. Even in this approach, the features\\\\nthat were considered are the number of pregnancies,\\\\nskinfold thickness, serum-insulin, BMI, DPF, and age and\\\\nthe main feature considered was the plasma-glucose level. It\\\\nwas observed that the predictions made by using neural\\\\nnetworks showed a higher accuracy, when compared with\\\\nother machine learning algorithms [22]. Research has been\\\\ncarried out on using deep neural networks (DNNs) as well\\\\nfor prediction of diabetics by training the DNN using Ô¨Åve-\\\\nfold and ten-fold cross validation. It is to be highlighted that\\\\nboth aforementioned approaches which were taken using\\\\nneural networks have shown an accuracy near 97% in di-\\\\nabetes prediction [23].\\\\n3.3. Heart Diseases. Heart diseases are severe events which\\\\nare caused by blockage inside the heart arteries. Chronic\\\\nheart disease is the rise of plaque inside the coronary arteries.\\\\nTis progresses slowly and could lead to a heart attack.\\\\nPeculiar glucose metabolism, extreme blood pressure, dys-\\\\nlipidaemia, smoking, lack of physical exercise, and age are\\\\nfew risk factors that have been identiÔ¨Åed for major heart\\\\ndiseases. Symptoms of a heart disease may include shortness\\\\nof breath, weakness of physical body, swollen feet and fatigue\\\\nwith related signs, and so on [14].\\\\nIn the Ô¨Åeld of cardiology, the tasks that precision\\\\nmedicine has performed include diagnostics as well as\\\\ntherapeutics in various subÔ¨Åelds. Interventional cardiology,\\\\npersonalized treatment options in correcting heart rhythms,\\\\nsome gender diÔ¨Äerences aÔ¨Äecting the outcome of cardio-\\\\nvascular diseases, and numerous works done in genomics\\\\ncan be highlighted as areas in which tasks have been per-\\\\nformed by precision medicine in cardiology. Nowadays, in\\\\nhealthcare informatics, there are services such as patient\\\\nmonitoring and clinical decision support systems (CDSSs).\\\\nWith the advancement of machine learning, now complex\\\\nproblems can be solved even by machines which was only\\\\npossible by humans, decades back. By utilizing these tech-\\\\nniques in precision medicine, the CDSS could be modiÔ¨Åed to\\\\nmake complex clinical decisions, recognizing newer phe-\\\\nnotypes and planning person-oriented specialized treatment\\\\noptions.\\\\nIn cardiology, blood tests are popular among the\\\\ndiÔ¨Äerent investigation methods in precision medicine.\\\\nAGES is a speciÔ¨Åc precision medicine test which utilizes\\\\nother factors in addition to blood tests to avoid ischemic\\\\nheart disease. In precision medicine, concern is mainly\\\\ngiven towards genetics and there are many research\\\\nstudies being carried out to Ô¨Ånd genetic causes of a\\\\ndisease. Cardiac genetics, cardiac oncology, and ischemic\\\\nheart disease can be identiÔ¨Åed as speciÔ¨Åc areas of interest\\\\nin precision cardiology. Methods such as blood tests,\\\\ngenetics tests, image tests, or even a combination of them\\\\nmay be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes\\\\nwhen advancing with precision medicine in cardiology.\\\\nMany cardiovascular diseases have their roots embedded\\\\nin genetics. Terefore, solutions using precision medicine\\\\nare considered more productive specially in these types of\\\\ndiseases. CNN, recurrent neural network (RNN), natural\\\\nlanguage processing (NLP), SVM, and long short-term\\\\nmemory (LSTM) are few machine learning techniques\\\\nwhich could be used eÔ¨Éciently to make precise CDSS\\\\nusing deep learning [24].\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\n7\\\\nA machine learning approach to identify cardiologic\\\\ndiseases includes preprocessing, feature selection, cross\\\\nvalidation method, machine learning classiÔ¨Åers, and clas-\\\\nsiÔ¨Åer performance evaluation. Tere are several pre-\\\\nprocessing techniques such as removing of missing values,\\\\nstandard scalar, and MinMax scalar. Feature selection is\\\\nimportant in machine learning as irrelevant features can\\\\naÔ¨Äect the classiÔ¨Åcation performance of the algorithm. By\\\\napplying feature selection prior to the classiÔ¨Åcation, the\\\\nexecution time is reduced and the accuracy of the classiÔ¨Å-\\\\ncation is increased. Tere are various feature selection al-\\\\ngorithms. Relief, Minimal Redundancy Maximal Relevance\\\\n(mRMR), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection\\\\nOperator (LASSO) are a few popular feature selection al-\\\\ngorithms [25].\\\\n3.4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). CKD is a type of a\\\\nkidney disease which gradually aÔ¨Äects the kidney func-\\\\ntionality and leads to kidney failure. CDK can be diagnosed\\\\nusing clinical data, lab tests, imaging studies, and biopsy. But\\\\nbiopsy has some disadvantages such as being invasive, costly,\\\\ntime-consuming, and sometimes being risky. Tis is where\\\\nmachine learning can be applied to overcome the afore-\\\\nmentioned disadvantages. In many disease predictions using\\\\nmachine learning, SVM was a commonly used classiÔ¨Åer. But\\\\nfor CKD, there is not much research that could be found that\\\\nuses SVM for the classiÔ¨Åcation. ANN, DT, and LR were the\\\\nmain machine learning classiÔ¨Åers used in this domain. When\\\\nobserving the obtained results, ANN showed far better\\\\nperformance when compared with DT and LR on CKD\\\\ndiagnosis [26].\\\\n3.5. Parkinson‚Äôs Disease (PD). PD is a chronic and pro-\\\\ngressive movement disorder. It has no causes, no permanent\\\\ncure, and limited treatment options. It is found that PD\\\\noccurs due to reduced production of dopamine, a chemical\\\\nthat controls movement and coordination. Tremors, rigidity,\\\\nslowness of movement, and postural instability are a few\\\\nsymptoms of PD. Abnormal writhing movement is a sig-\\\\nniÔ¨Åcant symptom of this disease. Some researchers have\\\\napplied machine learning algorithms on video recordings\\\\nand computer vision to diÔ¨Äerentiate healthy controls from\\\\nPD patients. Some researchers have also used voice samples\\\\nto diÔ¨Äerentiate healthy controls from PD patients [27]. PD\\\\nbelongs to the neurodegenerative disease category that may\\\\ndirectly or indirectly aÔ¨Äect the brain cells which will result in\\\\naÔ¨Äecting movement, speech, and other cognitive parts [28].\\\\nTe feature set for the classiÔ¨Åcation can be obtained\\\\nbased on PCA and genetic algorithm (GA). GA is inspired by\\\\nDarwin‚Äôs theory of evolution. A variable is considered as a\\\\ngene. Chromosomes are a sequence of a gene. A predeÔ¨Åned\\\\nfunction evaluates the quality of a chromosome and the\\\\nhigh-performing chromosome will be used to create the\\\\noÔ¨Äspring. Genetic operations such as mutation and cross-\\\\nover are used to create the oÔ¨Äspring. Basically, it is a\\\\ncompetition between the chromosomes in which the Ô¨Åttest\\\\nwill survive till the end. Tis is the concept which will be\\\\nbehind the feature extraction using the GA [29]. PCA is an\\\\nunsupervised linear conversion technique and a statistical\\\\ntechnique commonly used to identify new patterns in high-\\\\ndimensional data. Common applications that use PCA are\\\\nface recognition and image compression [30].\\\\n3.6. Dermatological Diseases. Dermatological diseases are\\\\ncomplex and have a large variety, and people have scarce\\\\nexpertise on it. Early detection is always preferred as it could\\\\nlead to serious outcomes. Eczema, herpes, melanoma, and\\\\npsoriasis are a few dermatological diseases which should be\\\\nidentiÔ¨Åed at the early stage to take life out of danger.\\\\nIn one approach that was taken to diagnose dermato-\\\\nlogical diseases, the Ô¨Årst phase involved data collection and\\\\ndata augmentation using images. Phase 2 is very important\\\\nas it is where the model is created and trained. In the last\\\\nphase, the image is converted to an array and the features are\\\\nbroken down using the trained model that was created.\\\\nTere are various augmentation techniques such as synthetic\\\\nminority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and computer\\\\nvision techniques like grey scaling, blurring, increasing\\\\ncontrast, changing the colour channel, sharpening, reducing\\\\nthe noise, and smoothing. When there are more instances in\\\\nthe database, it is better for the training of the model.\\\\nTraining the CNN with a large dataset overcomes the\\\\noverÔ¨Åtting problem. SVM classiÔ¨Åer is used for the predic-\\\\ntion. Te features in the Ô¨Ånal convolutional layer can be\\\\ndirectly given to the SVM as an input. But in order to do this,\\\\nthe SVM must be trained by giving the trained features from\\\\nthe Ô¨Ånal convolutional layer as the training dataset. Ten, the\\\\nSVM will convert it to vectors and store them [31].\\\\n4. Machine Learning in Medical Imaging\\\\nMedical imaging is a rapidly growing research area as it is\\\\nimportant to diagnose diseases in many instances. Several\\\\nsteps can be identiÔ¨Åed when observing the process of making\\\\npredictions from an image using machine learning. Once an\\\\nimage is given as the input, it will be divided into diÔ¨Äerent\\\\nsegments to zoom the interested area. Ten, with the use of\\\\ninformation retrieval techniques, features can be extracted\\\\nfrom those areas. Among them, the required features are\\\\nselected and the noise is removed. Finally, the classiÔ¨Åer will\\\\nclassify the extracted data and will make predictions based\\\\non the classiÔ¨Åcation.\\\\nNowadays, in the medical community, accurate diag-\\\\nnosis of a disease by processing large amounts of medical\\\\ndata is crucial. In the Ô¨Åeld of medicine and biology, there are\\\\nvarious tasks which are being carried out using machine\\\\nlearning algorithms. Distribution of data on the basis of their\\\\ncharacteristics, medical data examination, disease diagnosis\\\\nand treatment planning, data gathering and inspection,\\\\ncorrecting diagnostic of diÔ¨Äerent diseases by medical im-\\\\naging, and extracting features from medical images on\\\\ndiseases are just a few of the applications.\\\\nWhen further consideration is given towards the\\\\napplications of medical imaging, it can be observed that\\\\nmedical imaging is extensively being used to improve\\\\nplanning of surgical procedures with regard to many\\\\n8\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\ndiseases. Terefore, before discussing the involvement of\\\\nmachine learning in medical imaging, below mentioned\\\\nare a few such applications that would better explain how\\\\nmedical imaging is being applied in surgical planning to\\\\nobtain positive results while mitigating the risks.\\\\nAs the skull is one of the most complex areas in a human\\\\nbody in both anatomical and surgical perspectives, surgical\\\\nmanagement is extremely diÔ¨Écult when working with a wide\\\\nvariety of lesions. But during the last decades, the endonasal\\\\nendoscopic route was considered as a suitable approach for\\\\nseveral skull-based lesions. A main advantage is that when\\\\nperforming a skull-based surgery through the nose with the\\\\naid of an endoscope, direct visualization of neurovascular\\\\nstructures of diÔ¨Äerent areas of the skull base can be obtained\\\\nwith minimum brain displacement and manipulation. Te\\\\nendoscope also provides a wider and multiangle close-up\\\\nview which is of much importance in the surgical Ô¨Åeld [32].\\\\nFor diseases like rectal cancer, MRI plays a key role as it can\\\\naccurately depict the local extent of the cancer and generates\\\\nrelevant information required for prognoses which can\\\\ndirectly inÔ¨Çuence the choice of the optimal therapeutic\\\\nprocedure used for each individual patient which encourages\\\\nthe area of personalized medicine [33].\\\\nIt is to be noted that when image-guided surgeries are\\\\ncompared with conventional surgical approaches, image-\\\\nguided surgeries are less invasive, have more precise tar-\\\\ngeting, and have improved outcomes. Imaging is used to\\\\nplan, monitor progress, and to assess results. In neurosur-\\\\ngery, this is more crucial as the object of the surgical pro-\\\\ncedure is hard to be located and needs to be reached with\\\\nminimum damage to the healthy tissues. Apart from it, to\\\\nguide the placement of the surgical instruments and to\\\\nensure that the required tissue is being treated, medical\\\\nimaging is vital. At present, a wide variety of medical im-\\\\naging modalities are being used such as magnetic resonance\\\\nimaging,\\\\ncomputed\\\\ntomography,\\\\nultrasound,\\\\npositron\\\\nemission tomography, single-photon emission computed\\\\ntomography, Ô¨Çuoroscopy, and so on to perform diÔ¨Äerent\\\\nassessments like biopsies, tumour resection, epilepsy, vas-\\\\ncular conditions, and so on [34]. Medical image analysis is\\\\nevolving day by day with the development of technology.\\\\nTis is further assisted by 3D virtual model creation as well\\\\nto improve understanding of complex anatomy and to\\\\nprovide powerful tools for surgical planning and intra-\\\\noperative guidance. Nowadays, the use of 3D ultrasound and\\\\nfetal MRI is also becoming common in clinical practice [35].\\\\nTe interesting fact is how machine learning could be in-\\\\ntegrated with these medical imaging techniques to make\\\\nbetter decisions in surgical planning. It is to be noted that\\\\nusing machine learning, it is possible to understand hidden\\\\nrelationships which may not directly be visible to humans\\\\nwhen observing multiple data. Tis is the reason that even\\\\ndisease predictions in healthcare have been made possible\\\\nthrough machine learning approaches. Terefore, by pro-\\\\ncessing these medical image data using unsupervised ma-\\\\nchine learning techniques such as clustering, an analysis\\\\ncould be performed on the dataset which could later be\\\\nreferred by the surgeon to identify if any crucial information\\\\nhas been lost while planning the surgery or else to even\\\\nconÔ¨Årm that the decisions made on the approach of con-\\\\nducting the surgery is suitable for the considered patient.\\\\nEntities such as lesions and organs in medical images are\\\\ntoo complicated and they cannot be shown correctly with the\\\\nuse of simple mathematic solutions. Te pixel analysis in\\\\nmachine learning is used for medical image processing from\\\\nwhich certain values can be extracted directly from the\\\\nimage. Feature calculation and segmentation is not required\\\\nin pixel-based machine learning. Due to this, even an image\\\\nwith low contrast will have no issue in processing to extract\\\\ninformation. Pixel analysis utilizes longer training time\\\\nbecause of the high dimensionality of data. Histogram\\\\nequalization (HE) is an eÔ¨Écient technique which could be\\\\nused for contrast improvement. Tere are various other\\\\nextensions of HE which were implemented in order to\\\\nimprove the performance of the algorithm. Linear dis-\\\\ncriminant analysis (LDA), SVM, and DT are few machine\\\\nlearning methods used to analyse medical images. Low\\\\nbinary pattern descriptors are being implemented using\\\\nmachine learning approaches which could be used on bi-\\\\nological images. Te neural network technique is used in\\\\nmedical images to investigate the details regarding a disease.\\\\nMachine learning in medical imaging can also be found in\\\\nmedical-based expert systems [16].\\\\nCNN is one of the best models for image analysis. It has\\\\nseveral layers that could convert the input by using con-\\\\nvolution Ô¨Ålters. Tere are two sections in classiÔ¨Åcation with\\\\nregard to medical images. Tey are image classiÔ¨Åcation and\\\\nobject classiÔ¨Åcation. In image classiÔ¨Åcation, deep learning is\\\\nused to investigate clinical-related issues so that early\\\\ntreatment for the patient will be possible. In object classi-\\\\nÔ¨Åcation, the main target is to analyse more on interested\\\\nsmall chucks of the medical image. In medical image\\\\nanalysis, deep learning algorithms help in categorizing,\\\\nclassifying, and enumerating disease patterns using image\\\\nprocessing [16].\\\\nComputers have the ability of performing tasks con-\\\\nsistently and tirelessly. In the past years, machine learning\\\\nhas proved its ability to learn and master tasks which were\\\\nconsidered as too complex for machines to handle, and in\\\\nsome instances, they have been able to identify patterns\\\\nwhich are beyond human perception. When using machine\\\\nlearning on medical images, there are few terms which are\\\\nwidely used which need to be discussed. ClassiÔ¨Åcation means\\\\nlabelling or assigning a class to a group of pixels. Model is a\\\\nset of decision points which are learnt by the machine\\\\nlearning algorithm. Algorithm is the steps which have been\\\\ntaken to implement the model. Labelled data are the set of\\\\ndata which are examples for a speciÔ¨Åc class. Validation set or\\\\nthe training set is the set of data which is used to train the\\\\nsystem. Node is a part of a neural network which includes\\\\ntwo or more inputs and an activation function. A layer is a\\\\ncombination of nodes from which the outputs are computed.\\\\nSegmentation is a process of splitting the image into sections\\\\nso that more focus could be given to the split segments.\\\\nOverÔ¨Åtting is when a classiÔ¨Åer is too speciÔ¨Åc to the training\\\\nset and it is not useful as it is only familiar with those ex-\\\\namples. Having many features can lead to overÔ¨Åtting.\\\\nFeatures are the numeric values that represent the example.\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\n9\\\\nWhen it is with regard to medical images, it can be actual\\\\npixel values, edge strengths, variation in pixel values in a\\\\nregion, etc. Feature selection must be done in a way that the\\\\nselected subset of features is able to provide the best and the\\\\nmost accurate predictions [8].\\\\nImage recognition and biomedical time series classiÔ¨Å-\\\\ncation are nonlinear classiÔ¨Åcation problems. With the\\\\nexisting classiÔ¨Åcation algorithms and feature extraction\\\\ntechnologies, it is not possible to have highly complicated\\\\nnonlinear functions. But using DNN, nonlinear functions\\\\ncan be constructed by increasing the number of layers and\\\\nneurons in the network. With the use of ensemble learning,\\\\nmultiple classiÔ¨Åers could also be combined to have com-\\\\nplicated decision-making functions. Both in SVM and en-\\\\nsemble learning, nonlinear functions are constructed by\\\\ncombining multiple kernel functions. In the present context,\\\\nthe generation strategy is to later use the same learning\\\\nalgorithm. Terefore, diÔ¨Äerent settings such as learning\\\\nparameters and training samples are needed. Many methods\\\\nhave been developed having this idea, and they can be di-\\\\nvided into four categories. First is to manipulate the training\\\\nsamples. Bagging, boosting, cross-validated committees,\\\\nwagging, and arcing sort of approaches are needed for this.\\\\nTe second way is to manipulate the input features. Methods\\\\nsuch as random subspace, input decimation, and similarity-\\\\nbased feature space can be used for this purpose. Te third\\\\nway is to manipulate the class labels. Output coding and class\\\\nswitching are examples for this. Te fourth way is inserting\\\\nrandomness to the learning algorithm. Backpropagation\\\\nalgorithm, randomized Ô¨Årst-order inductive learner, and RF\\\\nare few approaches used for this. Te resulting classiÔ¨Åers\\\\nusing backpropagation will be quite diverse if diÔ¨Äerent initial\\\\nweights are applied to the same training samples in a neural\\\\nnetwork. Basically, it is visible that the underlying core of the\\\\ngeneration strategy is to make the individual classiÔ¨Åers\\\\ndiÔ¨Äerent so that it could be used to improve the classiÔ¨Åer\\\\nperformance [36].\\\\n5. Machine Learning in Biomedicine\\\\nGene expression datasets contain measurements of in-\\\\ncreasing and decreasing expression levels of a set of genes.\\\\nGene expression measurements are usually taken across time\\\\npoints from tissue samples or patients, and they are rep-\\\\nresented as a matrix of numerical values. In a protein-\\\\nprotein interaction network, the nodes represent biomole-\\\\ncules and the edges represent interactions. In any clustering\\\\nalgorithm, it is always better to have a minimum number of\\\\nuser inputs as it is hard for the users to specify correct values.\\\\nTese user inputs could aÔ¨Äect the accuracy of the algorithm\\\\nif they are incorrect [15].\\\\nNowadays, machine learning has become ubiquitous and\\\\nindispensable when it comes to solving complex problems in\\\\nmany areas. In biomedicine, machine learning is used for\\\\nvarious tasks such as to predict protein structure, function\\\\nfrom genetic sequences, discern optimal diets from patients\\\\nclinical and microbiome proÔ¨Åle, and so on. Machine\\\\nlearning is also used in processing real-time, high-resolution\\\\nphysiological data in various medical applications. Te\\\\ninvolvement of machine learning in biomedicine can be\\\\ndiscussed mainly in three approaches. First is that machine\\\\nlearning improves prognosis. Current prognostic models are\\\\nrestricted to few variables that humans must enter and tally\\\\nscores. But these data could be directly taken from EHRs and\\\\nthen it would allow models to use thousands of rich pre-\\\\ndictor variables which would increase the accuracy of the\\\\npredictions. Second is that machine learning will reduce the\\\\nwork of radiologists and anatomical pathologists. Normally,\\\\nthese physicians focus on interpreting digitalized images.\\\\nBut using machine learning algorithms, these images can be\\\\ngiven as an input, which would result in interpretations and\\\\npredictions provided by the algorithm. Sometimes, these\\\\ninterpretations even exceed the accuracy of humans. Apart\\\\nfrom it, the algorithms do not need rest, and they could work\\\\ncontinuously at the same accuracy which is not possible for\\\\nhumans in practice. Tird is that machine learning will\\\\nimprove the diagnostic accuracy by minimizing the diag-\\\\nnostic errors. But the challenge which needs to be faced here\\\\nis the complexity of training the algorithm as the predictions\\\\nare not binary. Even when working with EHR data, Ô¨Årst the\\\\ndata need to be preprocessed to be accessible to the algo-\\\\nrithms as they are often stored in an unstructured format.\\\\nData themselves are not useful, but they need to be\\\\nanalysed, interpreted, and acted on to make them useful.\\\\nAlgorithms are required to perform the aforementioned\\\\ntasks with datasets. Terefore, new statistical tools from the\\\\nmachine learning Ô¨Åeld are critical when practicing medicine\\\\nin the present time. Most of the computer-based algorithms\\\\nin medicine are expert systems. Tey have a set of rules and\\\\nknowledge which are being applied to make conclusions\\\\nwith regard to speciÔ¨Åc clinical scenarios. Tis is an approach\\\\nthat is similar to a medical student where the general\\\\nprinciples about medicine are being applied on new patients.\\\\nBut machine learning is much diÔ¨Äerent than the above\\\\ndiscussed, as in a machine learning approach, rules are being\\\\nlearnt from the data themselves. It starts with the patient\\\\nlevel observations and checks through vast number of\\\\nvariables to look for combinations that could reliably predict\\\\nthe outcome. Te highlight in machine learning is the\\\\nenormous number of predictors that it handles. Sometimes,\\\\nthere are more predictors than observations and they need to\\\\nbe combined in a nonlinear and highly interactive way to\\\\ngenerate accurate outcomes.\\\\nTruly independent validation datasets must be used from\\\\ndiÔ¨Äerent populations and periods which have no relation\\\\nwith the model development when testing the models. If not\\\\nin the validation stage, the algorithm will have poor per-\\\\nformance. Machine learning algorithms need high-quality\\\\ndata in high quantities to reach acceptable performance\\\\nlevels. If the dataset is biased, it can aÔ¨Äect the performance\\\\nand the generalizability of the algorithm. Machine learning\\\\nis not capable of solving any fundamental problems of causal\\\\ninference in the observational dataset. Even though the\\\\nalgorithm is good in predicting the outcomes, yet it is to be\\\\nnoted that these predictors are not the causes [37].\\\\nMany research studies have given binary interpretations\\\\non whether a person is being diagnosed with a particular\\\\ndisease or not. Sometimes, regarding a particular disease, it\\\\n10\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\nmay show the stage of the disease as well. It could be noticed\\\\nthat these research studies have been based on a particular\\\\ndisease, but not many diseases together. To address the said\\\\nlimitation, a method was proposed called ensemble label\\\\npower-set pruned dataset joint decomposition (ELPPJD).\\\\nTe label power-set (LP) method overcomes the indepen-\\\\ndence problem and takes the correlation among labels into\\\\nconsideration. But the issues are that the time complexity\\\\nincreases with the size of the label set and the imbalanced\\\\nproblem keeps on rising when new label sets are produced.\\\\nPruned datasets and joint decomposition can be used to\\\\novercome these issues. In this approach, when creating new\\\\nclasses, all these training data will be broken down into\\\\nsubsets which are disjoint. Ten, using a similarity threshold,\\\\nthe labels which are more similar to each other will be\\\\ngrouped. Te subset partition strategies can be size balanced\\\\n(SB) and label similarity (LS). Random K-label sets (RAKEL)\\\\nand hierarchy of multilabel classiÔ¨Åers (HOMER) are mul-\\\\ntilabel classifying methods which can be used as alternatives\\\\nfor this approach. RAKEL runs based on MEKA, and C4.5 is\\\\nthe basic classiÔ¨Åcation algorithm. HOMER runs based on\\\\nMULAN, and RF is the basic classiÔ¨Åcation algorithm.\\\\nRAKEL shows better performance than HOMER. But\\\\nELPPJD with LS partition strategy outperforms both RAKEL\\\\nand HOMER [38].\\\\n6. Machine Learning in Biomedical\\\\nEvent Extraction\\\\nTe relationship between the disease and the drug, the re-\\\\nlationship between the disease and the gene, the interaction\\\\nbetween drugs, and the interaction between proteins are\\\\nbiological events which have complex structures. To extract\\\\nthese biomedical events accurately and eÔ¨Éciently, bio-\\\\nmedical text mining technology is important as the amount\\\\nof unstructured and semistructured biomedical literature\\\\ndata is rapidly growing.\\\\nPattern-based methods are used in biomedical relation\\\\nextraction. But they are not much used in biomedical event\\\\nextraction. Event extraction systems are mainly divided into\\\\ntwo types which are rule-based event extraction systems and\\\\nmachine learning-based event extraction systems. In the\\\\nmachine learning approach, the task of extracting bio-\\\\nmedical events is considered as a classiÔ¨Åcation problem. Te\\\\nhighly unbalanced training dataset given in biomedical event\\\\nextraction is an issue, and most of the systems do not address\\\\nthis problem. But SVM addresses this issue using the simple\\\\nclass weighting strategy. Machine learning-based event ex-\\\\ntraction systems have three types. First type is the pipeline\\\\nmodel. Te pipeline model has achieved excellent results in\\\\nthe event extraction task. But the drawbacks in it are that the\\\\ntime complexity is high and each step is based on the\\\\nprevious step. Terefore, if there is an error, that error would\\\\nbe carried till the Ô¨Ånal step. Second type is the joint model.\\\\nTis model overcame the previous drawbacks discussed, yet\\\\nit involves complicated calculations. Tird type is the\\\\npairwise model. Tis is a combination of both pipeline and\\\\njoint models. Pairwise model is faster than the joint model\\\\nand more accurate than the pipeline model. Tis model uses\\\\nSVM to overcome the multiclass and multilabel classiÔ¨Åca-\\\\ntion problem without dealing with data imbalance.\\\\nA system proposed to extract biomedical events from\\\\nimbalanced data has several steps. First, text preprocessing\\\\nwill be carried out using token features, sentence features,\\\\nsentence dependency features, and external resource fea-\\\\ntures. Next is the sample selection, based on sequential\\\\npatterns. It aims to Ô¨Ånd the frequent subsequence or se-\\\\nquential events that satisfy the minimum support. Tis\\\\nincludes the extraction of sequential patterns in the text.\\\\nTen, the detection of multiargument events is performed,\\\\nfollowed by the joint scoring mechanism. Tis will result in\\\\nobtaining the outcome. Te tool sentence2vec, based on\\\\nconvolutional deep structured semantic models (C-DSSMs),\\\\nis used to calculate the semantic relevance score [39].\\\\nUsing SVM, it is possible to separate event extraction\\\\ninto multiple classiÔ¨Åcation tasks, individually detecting the\\\\ntrigger words deÔ¨Åning events and the arguments that de-\\\\nscribe which proteins or genes take part in these events. Tis\\\\nis based on labelled data and supervised learning algorithms.\\\\nBut the issue is that these systems get aÔ¨Äected by data\\\\nsparseness. Especially, it happens when the training dataset\\\\nis too small to Ô¨Ånd enough information to assign proper\\\\nweights to those low-frequency or out-of-vocabulary fea-\\\\ntures. Terefore, research was carried out to implement\\\\nsystems that would use the semisupervised or the unsu-\\\\npervised machine learning approach to extract biomedical\\\\nevents. In PubMed, a large pool of unlabelled data with\\\\npotential information with regard to the biomedical event\\\\nextraction domain can be found to go ahead with the re-\\\\nsearch. Te basic features are obtained by the labelled data\\\\nand the information which is lacking in labelled data can be\\\\nobtained from unlabelled data using the event feature\\\\ncoupling generalization strategy. Sparse features that were\\\\nÔ¨Åltered by supervised machine learning methods can be used\\\\nto increase the performance of the system while these could\\\\neven be considered when using a semisupervised machine\\\\nlearning approach for biomedical event extraction [40].\\\\nProteins are the end products of a gene expression.\\\\nUnderstanding the gene function at the proteome level is a\\\\nsigniÔ¨Åcant interest in the biological and medical research\\\\ncommunity. Tere are large repositories of protein data\\\\nwhose characteristics are unknown as noting their func-\\\\ntional features using experimental methods have lagged far\\\\nbehind. Tis creates a need of a computational method to\\\\naddress the issue by accurately working on the large datasets\\\\neven with a limited amount of labelled data. Functional,\\\\nstructural, and evolutionary characteristics of the protein\\\\ncan be extracted by using the protein sequence information.\\\\nTe aim of protein classiÔ¨Åcation is to extract this infor-\\\\nmation accurately, and it has only been possible with the\\\\napplication of machine learning algorithms to analyse the\\\\nprotein data repositories [41].\\\\n7. Machine Learning\\\\nApproaches to Polypharmacology\\\\nPolypharmacology focuses on designing medical treatment\\\\nthat can target multiple receptors. Te eÔ¨Écacy and toxicity of\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\n11\\\\ndrugs result from complex interactions between pharma-\\\\ncodynamic, pharmacokinetic, genetic, epigenetic, and en-\\\\nvironmental factors even though it may be designed as a\\\\nsingle or multitarget treatment. Machine learning-related\\\\ncomputational techniques are required to enable the pre-\\\\ndiction and analysis of in vitro and in vivo drug-response\\\\nphenotypes.\\\\nIdentiÔ¨Åcation of drug-target interaction on a proteome-\\\\nwide scale is essential to deÔ¨Åne and predict a drug response.\\\\nApart from its genetic and epigenetic variations, cell-to-cell\\\\ncommunication, cell-to-cell variability, and other environ-\\\\nmental factors must also be considered. System-based ap-\\\\nproaches help in drug discovery as they could identify\\\\ncellular connectivity between all the aforementioned com-\\\\nponents. New computational methods are needed to ac-\\\\ncurately calculate free-energy landscapes during association\\\\nand dissociation of protein-ligand complexes. It will allow to\\\\ninvestigate quantitatively both low and high aÔ¨Énity binding\\\\non a proteome-wide scale. Self-organizing map is an un-\\\\nsupervised machine learning technique that is used to cluster\\\\ndrug molecules. Prediction of drug-target interactions can\\\\nbe done by combining the sequence features of the receptor\\\\nwith the Ô¨Ångerprint of the ligand, in order to train modules\\\\nbased on statistical machine learning. Tere are four com-\\\\nputational areas which are crucial in polypharmacology, and\\\\nthey are the proteome-wide prediction of drug-target in-\\\\nteractions, the quantitative modelling of protein-ligand\\\\ninteractions, the integrated analysis of biological networks,\\\\nand the dynamic and stoichiometric simulation of biological\\\\nnetworks [42].\\\\nNGS includes both DNA and RNA sequencing. It in-\\\\nvolves the task of braking DNA and RNA into fragments and\\\\ndetermining the order of the nucleotide bases in each\\\\nfragment. DNA sequencing can either be whole genome\\\\nsequencing (WGS) or whole exome sequencing (WES) of the\\\\ncoding regions of all known genes and targeted sequencing\\\\nof genomic regions or genes implicated in a disease. WGS\\\\nand WES can be found in clinical practices to evaluate\\\\ndevelopmental brain disorders such as autism, seizures, and\\\\nintellectual disability. Tere are commercially available se-\\\\nquencing platforms which use various methods to generate\\\\nsequence data. With the continuous modiÔ¨Åcations resulted\\\\nfrom the advancement of technologies, NGS-based plat-\\\\nforms have shown a comparatively low error rate. In NGS\\\\ntechnologies, Sanger sequencing is considered to be the most\\\\naccurate sequencing method and it is often used for the\\\\nvalidation of genetic variants due to its high accuracy [43].\\\\nWhen modern machine learning is combined with\\\\nmedical practice by using clinical data sources, various\\\\nprediction models could be generated for similar clinical\\\\nquestions. From early warning systems till superhuman\\\\nimaging diagnostics, there are many applications of machine\\\\nlearning in medical practice. Machine learning methods\\\\nprovide predictions based on existing data. Te Google Ô¨Çu\\\\nreminds how forecasting an annual event based on 1 year of\\\\ndata could lead to time series problems. Having loads of data\\\\nover the past time has diminishing returns. Basically, it is\\\\nfound in research on decision support algorithms that it is\\\\nbetter to use the most recent year data instead of historical\\\\ndata of multiple years for better accurate decisions. Even\\\\nwhen evaluating prediction models, the main idea behind\\\\nthis is not about the ability to do repetitions of historical\\\\ntrends but the accuracy it has on predicting future trends. It\\\\nis true that machine learning algorithms can improve the\\\\nprediction accuracy by using conventional regression\\\\nmodels by capturing complex and nonlinear relationships in\\\\nthe data. But it is to be noted that even though highest\\\\ncomputing power is provided, there is no possibility of\\\\ngetting information that is not present. Terefore, using\\\\nclinical data alone has limited the prediction power. By\\\\nincorporating the correct data streams, the level of pre-\\\\ndiction accuracy can be improved. But not even a simple\\\\nnonlinear system can precisely predict the distant future.\\\\nTiny variations which seem nothing and very less important\\\\nrounding errors can accumulate and make a massive impact\\\\non future events [44].\\\\n8. Machine Learning for Drug Repurposing\\\\nUsing System Biology\\\\nMore than 90% of the drugs that go through the early phases\\\\nof clinical trials fail due to reasons such as adverse reactions,\\\\nside eÔ¨Äects, or lack of eÔ¨Éciency. To overcome these chal-\\\\nlenges, drug repurposing has been considered. Repurposing\\\\ndrugs can be either drug-based or disease-based. Drugs that\\\\nare strongly anticorrelated with a disease are likely to be\\\\ncandidates for repurposing. Te connectivity map was the\\\\nÔ¨Årst project that aimed to explore the functional connectivity\\\\nbetween drugs. It even considered the functional connec-\\\\ntivity between drugs and diseases. Systems biology can be\\\\nused to discover and develop drugs by giving concern to the\\\\ninteractions of the components in biological entities. Drugs\\\\nare being ranked based on the amount of perturbation they\\\\ncause on speciÔ¨Åc disease-related genes.\\\\nA drug disease network (DDN) is constructed by inte-\\\\ngrating the knowledge on disease-related genes, drug targets,\\\\nsignalling pathways, and gene-gene interactions. Te DDN\\\\nrepresents all the interactions between drug targets and\\\\ngenes, related to a given disease as described in Kyoto\\\\nEncyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signalling\\\\npathways. Te repurposing scores of the drug-disease pairs\\\\nare calculated using the Pearson correlation coeÔ¨Écient be-\\\\ntween their gene perturbation signatures, and it can take a\\\\nvalue between 1 to ‚àí1. A high positive value indicates that\\\\nthe drug and the disease both cause similar perturbations to\\\\nthe system, and a high negative value indicates that the drug\\\\nand the disease have opposite gene perturbation signatures.\\\\nBy using this value, it can be recognized whether it is a drug\\\\nthat could be considered as a treatment to a given disease\\\\n[45].\\\\nTerefore, it is clear that when a patient approaches and\\\\nexpects support from healthcare, the decision making starts\\\\nin the process of the patient being diagnosed with a disease\\\\nand it continues till the proper treatment or medication is\\\\nprescribed for the patient. In this process, which is a chain of\\\\ndecisions, to support each decision, machine learning ap-\\\\nproaches are involved in healthcare. Tasks such as predicting\\\\nor diagnosing a disease, identifying hidden diseases,\\\\n12\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\nproviding clinical decision support, and even recognizing\\\\nwhether a drug is suitable as a treatment to the given disease\\\\nare being conducted using machine learning approaches to\\\\nsupport clinicians to make fast and accurate decisions.\\\\nStepping further ahead, even after a patient is cured from a\\\\ndisease, using machine learning approaches, the EHRs of\\\\npatients are processed and analysed to identify any future\\\\nhealth risks that could possibly occur.\\\\n9. Discussion\\\\nIn this section, the main concern would be given towards\\\\nhighlighting important and crucial facts of the topics dis-\\\\ncussed throughout the paper. To start with, it is better to give\\\\nconcern towards the performance of machine learning al-\\\\ngorithms. To identify best performing algorithms, classiÔ¨Åer\\\\naccuracy and the classiÔ¨Åer log loss are two factors that can be\\\\nconsidered. Te classiÔ¨Åer accuracy needs to be high and the\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åer log loss needs to be low for an algorithm to be\\\\nidentiÔ¨Åed as a well-performing algorithm. Terefore, once\\\\nselecting a suitable algorithm to address a speciÔ¨Åc concern,\\\\nthe aforementioned factors are considered to select the al-\\\\ngorithm out of many diÔ¨Äerent existing algorithms that\\\\nwould best suit our purpose.\\\\nIn most clustering algorithms, the eÔ¨Äectiveness of the\\\\nalgorithm depends on the appropriate parameters that the\\\\nuser inputs. For example, parameters like number of ex-\\\\npected clusters, a starting point in the dataset, minimum\\\\nnumber of samples to form a cluster, and so on aÔ¨Äect the\\\\nclustering result. Tis is a serious issue when biological and\\\\nbiomedical data are considered as they are nonspherical and\\\\nhigh-dimensional. Automatic density clustering method\\\\nwith multiple kernels (ADCMK) is a proposed option to\\\\nanswer the said issue. Using that method, clusters with\\\\narbitrary shape can be easily identiÔ¨Åed based on their\\\\ndensity. When comparing the conventional clustering al-\\\\ngorithms, ADCMK automatically determines optimal values\\\\nfor the cutoÔ¨Ädistance, kernel weights, and number of\\\\nclusters and centroids which will not change the clustering\\\\nresult when executed time to time. It also has comparatively\\\\nbetter accuracy. Multiple kernel clustering approaches help\\\\nin optimally combining the learning algorithms in order to\\\\nobtain excellent clustering results and performance in\\\\nvarious scenarios. Tey are mostly suitable to handle labelled\\\\ndatasets as they are a part of supervised kernel learning.\\\\nTere is also an unsupervised multiple kernel learning ap-\\\\nproach that aims to determine the linear combination of\\\\nmultiple kernels based on an unlabelled dataset [46].\\\\nIt is not possible to exactly highlight which algorithm is\\\\nbetter than the other. Te reason is that it depends on the\\\\ndomain that the training and the tests are being executed, the\\\\ndataset that is involved in the training and testing proce-\\\\ndures, the level of preprocessing that is being performed on\\\\nthe dataset, the selected feature set for the algorithm or the\\\\nfeature selection algorithms that have been used on the\\\\ndataset, the size of the dataset and the data types in the\\\\ndataset, the performance level and the capacity of the ma-\\\\nchine, and much more. Tis makes it vital to select the\\\\nproper algorithm that would be ideal for the requirement.\\\\nNormally, this cannot be directly selected, but it will be an\\\\niterative process to select the most suitable algorithm from a\\\\nÔ¨Åltered set of algorithms which would best Ô¨Åt the problem in\\\\nhand. Te proper knowledge and past experiences gathered\\\\nwill help in constructing the Ô¨Åltered set of algorithms. When\\\\nlooking at a simple example from the biomedical Ô¨Åeld, it can\\\\nbe seen that for the diagnosis of various diseases, the best\\\\nperforming algorithm changes due to the aforementioned\\\\nreason. Tis could be further explained by looking at the\\\\nscenarios below, in detail.\\\\nMany studies have been carried out using ANN, DT,\\\\nand LR to diagnose kidney diseases, and ANN has out-\\\\nperformed both DT and LR by a huge margin [26].\\\\nAccording to previous studies, it is to be noted that the\\\\naccuracy of the results obtained with regard to lung\\\\ncancer diagnosis is in the order of SVM, ANN, and DT.\\\\nApart from them, various other techniques also have been\\\\nused and they have also showed a reasonable level of\\\\naccuracy. Tese algorithms are GA, BPNN, HopÔ¨Åeld\\\\nneural network, and LDA [30]. Another beneÔ¨Åt that could\\\\nbe gained by using SVM classiÔ¨Åcation is that through\\\\nSVM, it is possible to calculate even the stage of the lung\\\\ncancer [18]. Regression can be used to model and predict\\\\nthe association between the dependent variable and the\\\\nindependent variable. Regression can be categorized as\\\\nlinear regression and logistic regression. For linear re-\\\\ngression, the dependent variable should be continuous,\\\\nand for logistic regression, the dependent variable should\\\\nbe discrete. Using the logistic regression algorithm to\\\\npredict complex disease such as cancer must be avoided.\\\\nKNN is not suitable for cancer predictions as the datasets\\\\nare huge and more complex which could make the\\\\nclustering process more diÔ¨Écult [47]. It was found that\\\\nDNN has better performance for breast cancer detection.\\\\nTen ANN, SVM, and KNN were ranked in the given\\\\norder with regard to their performance [48]. It is to be\\\\nnoted that DNN has also shown higher accuracy in\\\\npredicting diabetics compared with the other standard\\\\nmachine learning algorithms. When discussing extract-\\\\ning of medical data from documents, datasets, databases,\\\\nmedical images, etc. for analysing purposes, various CNN\\\\nalgorithms can be used to extract features from un-\\\\nstructured data. For structured data, NB, KNN, and DT\\\\nalgorithms can be used. For textual data which are un-\\\\nstructured, CNN-based unimodal disease risk prediction\\\\n(CNN-UDRP) can be used. For both structured and\\\\nunstructured data, CNN-based multimodal disease risk\\\\nprediction (CNN-MDRP) can be used. In the CNN-\\\\nUDRP algorithm, tests are represented in the form of a\\\\nvector. For each word, the distributed representation of\\\\nthe word embedding found in NLP is used. When\\\\nworking with CNN, it is required to specify the number of\\\\nwords for the sliding window. When assigning a value for\\\\nthe sliding window, it is important to assign a value that\\\\nwould help in reaching the highest accuracy when it is\\\\nbeing used [8]. When giving concern to these aspects,\\\\nwhat could be seen is how these machine learning ap-\\\\nproaches assist in healthcare decision making of the\\\\nclinicians. When analysing reports and when going\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\n13\\\\nthrough the patients‚Äô medical history, these algorithms\\\\nare used to highlight the factors that deÔ¨Ånitely need to be\\\\nconsidered by the clinician when prescribing treatment.\\\\nIn addition to it, these algorithms are also used to assist in\\\\nidentifying the level that the disease has spread in the\\\\npatient so that the treatment can be given accordingly\\\\nbased on the disease severity.\\\\nMoving on to the next topic, which is medical imaging, it\\\\nis visible that currently, medical image classiÔ¨Åcation is\\\\nmostly based on pattern recognition methods. It has been\\\\nfound that classiÔ¨Åcation-based neural networks have better\\\\nperformance than other supervised machine learning al-\\\\ngorithms. Deep learning is considered as a combination of\\\\nboth supervised and unsupervised methods. Te reason is\\\\nthat it initially relies on unsupervised learning for training\\\\nthe DNN and then to Ô¨Åne tune the neural network, it uses\\\\nsupervised learning. When compared with various classiÔ¨Å-\\\\ncation algorithms, CNN combined with adaptive sliding\\\\nwindow fusion mechanism has good stability and robustness\\\\nalong with high classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy. Even when it is for\\\\nbreast tumour or brain tumour diagnosis, the aforemen-\\\\ntioned approach with CNN has given comparatively better\\\\nresults [49]. As both deep learning and ensemble learning\\\\ncan construct complicated nonlinear functions, by com-\\\\nbining them, it is possible to handle more complex tasks.\\\\nBiomedical time series often has interfering noise. But when\\\\ntrying to eliminate the noise, along with it some useful\\\\ninformation might also be lost. DNN has the ability to\\\\ncapture useful information while ignoring the interfering\\\\nnoise after learning from training samples. Presently, DNN\\\\nmainly includes CNN, deep belief network (DBN), and\\\\nautoencoder (AE). CNN performs convolution operations\\\\non both horizontal and vertical directions. Tis is a good\\\\napproach for image data as it is relevant in both directions.\\\\nBut for biomedical time series with multiple channels, this is\\\\nnot suitable as only horizontal direction is relevant and the\\\\nvertical direction is independent. For this reason, multi-\\\\nchannel CNN can also be implemented to obtain better\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åcation performance [36].\\\\nWhen further observed, it is also visible that in the\\\\npresent context, medical imaging has also been combined\\\\nwith the 3D printing technology to achieve greater success\\\\nspecially when surgical planning is to be considered. 3D\\\\nprinting can turn a 3D medical image dataset into a 3D\\\\nobject as per the patient‚Äôs actual size. Tis can largely im-\\\\nprove the precision of modern surgical planning by com-\\\\nbining with other preoperative plan and intraoperative\\\\nnavigation techniques. By combining these with the cloud\\\\ncomputing architecture, there is further space for im-\\\\nprovement in cost eÔ¨Éciency, Ô¨Çexibility, and clinical work-\\\\nÔ¨Çow. Terefore, further exploration needs to be done on 3D\\\\nprinting and cloud computing technologies of their usage in\\\\nthe surgical realm. Nowadays, surgeons are able to perform\\\\nrisky procedures with high level of safety and accuracy with\\\\nthe development of multimodality imaging, with regard to\\\\nespecially the fusion of functional imaging in preoperative\\\\nplanning and modern image guided therapy in intra-\\\\noperative navigation. With the development of medical\\\\nimaging technology, there are multiple imaging processing\\\\nsystems and intraoperative imaging guided platforms which\\\\nare being introduced that are powerful but also complicated\\\\n[50]. In addition to it, 3D printing has also been used to\\\\ndesign advanced prosthetic devices with the aim of devel-\\\\noping a realistic model which is closely similar to the actual\\\\npart with regard to the geometry and mechanical properties.\\\\nWhen making such products, even though the geometry can\\\\nbe easily obtained by the 3D scanned data, the mechanical\\\\nproperties need to be mechanically validated and a major\\\\nconcern should be given towards composite material\\\\ntechnology [51]. A few of the currently existing Ô¨Åndings on\\\\nprosthetic devices are brieÔ¨Çy discussed below.\\\\nTe concept of creating a soft total artiÔ¨Åcial heart from\\\\nsilicon elastomers using the lost-wax casting technique has\\\\nalso been possible as the 3D printing technology has enabled\\\\nthe production of entirely soft pumps with complex chamber\\\\ngeometries. Even though it is not yet readily implantable, it\\\\npromotes the future of personalized medicine and artiÔ¨Åcial\\\\nheart development without requiring expensive and com-\\\\nplex equipment [52]. By using an array of semiconductor\\\\nphoto detectors which are made of polymers and printed on\\\\na glass hemisphere, a 3D printed prototype of a bionic eye\\\\nhas been designed and further research is being carried out\\\\non ways to improve the eÔ¨Éciency of the photo detectors and\\\\nto Ô¨Ånd a way to print on a soft hemispherical material that\\\\ncould be implanted to a real human eye [53]. Researchers\\\\nhave also developed a 3D printed tooth that also kills bacteria\\\\nusing conventional artiÔ¨Åcial tooth resins combined with\\\\npositively charged quaternary ammonium ions [54]. In\\\\nanother study, a handheld portable printer was developed\\\\nwhich could be used to create narrow sheets of skin tissue\\\\nmade from collagen and Ô¨Åbrin to cover and heal deep\\\\nwounds. Tis printer can tailor tissues based on the patient\\\\nand the wound characteristics within two minutes or less.\\\\nFurther research is being carried out on ways to expand the\\\\nsize of the printed strips so that larger wounds could be\\\\ncovered [55]. Bioengineers have 3D printed artiÔ¨Åcial\\\\nhyperelastic bones which could quickly induce bone re-\\\\ngeneration and growth. Currently, it has been implanted\\\\nsuccessfully in animal models and a main advantage in this\\\\napproach is that the 3D printing process can customize any\\\\nshape of a bone as per the requirement and can create it\\\\nwithin a day. It is to be noted that the materials used to create\\\\nthese 3D printed bones are Ô¨Çexible, and after combining\\\\nthem with the bone structure, with time, they bond with the\\\\nexisting bones and become a part of the human body [56]. A\\\\ngroup of scientists has 3D printed a bionic ear with an\\\\nantenna and a cartilage that can hear the radio frequencies\\\\neven beyond the range of a normal human‚Äôs capability. It has\\\\nalso been created in such a way that the electrical signals\\\\nproduced from the ear can be connected with the nerve\\\\nendings which is considered to be the Ô¨Årst time that 3D\\\\nprinting was eÔ¨Äectively used to interweave tissues with\\\\nelectronics [57]. Tere are many such prosthetic devices\\\\nwhich were outcomes of previous research studies that were\\\\ncarried out, and further research is being conducted on them\\\\npresently to improve the existing results. Medical imaging,\\\\n3D printing technologies, and various other computational\\\\napproaches have been vital when conducting these research\\\\n14\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\nstudies to obtain improved results. When giving concern to\\\\nhow machine learning could be involved in these Ô¨Åndings, it\\\\nis visible that machine learning approaches could analyse\\\\nlarge biological and material datasets to identify various\\\\nrelationships which exist between the data. In addition to it,\\\\nas machine learning is used to detect diseases and the se-\\\\nverity level of it, these machine learning algorithms can be\\\\ncombined with the equipment that is being used to design\\\\nsuch prosthetic devices so that when the medical dataset is\\\\ngiven, an analysis is to be performed so that the devices can\\\\nbe customized and designed based on the patient‚Äôs re-\\\\nquirement which would further encourage the latest trend in\\\\nhealthcare, which is personalized medicine.\\\\nWhen discussing biomedicine, biomedical data play an\\\\nimportant role which cannot be neglected. It is vital to\\\\nextract the required knowledge from biomedical data that\\\\nwould make paths visible to explore the subject matters\\\\nfurther. When giving concern towards bioinformatics and\\\\nbiomedical data, there are various documents that contain\\\\nhigh-dimensional data with large number of attributes such\\\\nas categorical images and text records. To extract infor-\\\\nmation from such documents eÔ¨Éciently and with high ac-\\\\ncuracy,\\\\nt-distributed\\\\nstochastic\\\\nneighbour\\\\nembedding\\\\nmethod could be used. It is a popular method for exploring\\\\nhigh-dimensional data in the Ô¨Åeld of machine learning and\\\\ncan be incorporated with the multiple kernel approach as\\\\nwell. ADCMK performs data preprocessing, optimal com-\\\\nbined kernel determination, cluster centroid detection, and\\\\nassignment and visualization of clusters which shows ex-\\\\ncellent results when working with larger-scale biological and\\\\nbiomedical datasets without class label information [46].\\\\nUnder biomedical event extraction, the challenges that\\\\nprotein classiÔ¨Åcation tasks need to face due to the limited\\\\ndata that are available for learning and the unbalanced\\\\nclasses in those existing data need to be considered and\\\\naddressed. Expectation-maximization-based algorithms are\\\\nthere to address these challenges by incorporating unlabelled\\\\ndata. Even by using the n-gram model for the feature space\\\\nwith the NB classiÔ¨Åer, the accuracy of the model could be\\\\nimproved to some extent without using unlabelled data. Te\\\\ntransductive support vector machine (TSVM) method is a\\\\nsemisupervised learning approach that also could be used in\\\\naddressing the said issues. But there are other semi-\\\\nsupervised algorithms as well that could perform better in\\\\ncertain classiÔ¨Åcation problems [41].\\\\nWhile coming towards the machine learning ap-\\\\nproaches to polypharmacology, it is important to rec-\\\\nognize about certain risks or loopholes which can be\\\\nfound when integrating machine learning algorithms\\\\nwith biology and biomedicine. In some occasions, there\\\\nmay be identical twins with the same observable demo-\\\\ngraphic characteristics, lifestyle, medical care, and ge-\\\\nnetics which will provide same predictions by a machine\\\\nlearning algorithm but will end up in totally unexpected\\\\ndiÔ¨Äerent outcomes. Tis is an instance to show that the\\\\nincorporation of machine learning with biology and\\\\nbiomedicine should be performed with maximum care\\\\nand monitoring. Research studies are growing in number\\\\ntrying to increase the accuracy of the predictions made,\\\\nbut still these algorithms do not state how to change the\\\\nobtained outcome. It even does not assure whether it is\\\\npossible to change the received outcomes in any possible\\\\nway. Machine learning-based identiÔ¨Åcations are strong,\\\\nbut they are theory free. Tis means that no theory-based\\\\nexplanations can be provided, even for the generated\\\\npredictions. Sometimes, the most accurate predictions\\\\nmade by machine learning algorithms are obvious to the\\\\npracticing clinicians as well. Even though predictive al-\\\\ngorithms cannot eliminate medical uncertainty, they\\\\nimprove allocation of scarce healthcare resources. Using\\\\nDNN, now early warning systems can be rapidly devel-\\\\noped and optimized using real-world data. Tese systems\\\\nwill also have capabilities which seemed to be impossible\\\\nto be achieved previously [44].\\\\nHere onwards the discussion will give concern towards\\\\nincreasing the productivity of applications through in-\\\\ncreasing the performance of the machine learning algo-\\\\nrithms. In order to increase the performance and the\\\\neÔ¨Éciency of machine learning algorithms, various steps and\\\\nmeasures are being carried out and tested by the researchers.\\\\nWhen observing the said fact, next are a few instances to get\\\\nan idea of what sort of tasks are being conducted to increase\\\\nthe performance of the algorithms. When considering the\\\\naccuracy, sensitivity, and the speciÔ¨Åcity of classiÔ¨Åers while\\\\nchanging the number of folds, any major Ô¨Çuctuation was not\\\\nfound in the values obtained in the confusion matrix. All\\\\nwere just small variations in the Ô¨Ånal decimal places which\\\\ncan be ignored [26]. But DNN, feature selection methods,\\\\nand cross validation techniques can be applied to increase\\\\nthe classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy [10, 58]. It is also to be noted that\\\\npositive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value\\\\n(NPV), accuracy, sensitivity, and speciÔ¨Åcity attributes show\\\\nan improvement when a classiÔ¨Åer is applied after performing\\\\nPCA rather than the classiÔ¨Åer being applied to the oÔ¨Écial\\\\nfeature set (OFS). But when the GA was used instead of the\\\\nPCA, all the above attributes showed a further improvement\\\\neven than what was resulted after the PCA has been applied\\\\n[29].\\\\nEnsemble learner is constructed by a collection of\\\\nindividual classiÔ¨Åers. When there is a pattern classiÔ¨Å-\\\\ncation problem, it is solved by a combination of multiple\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åer outputs. Majority voting, bagging, and boosting\\\\nare few well-known ensemble methods which can be used\\\\nto combine the outputs. Normally, this approach is more\\\\naccurate than using a single classiÔ¨Åer. In the majority\\\\nvoting method, the label to be assigned is decided based\\\\non the majority of the individual classiÔ¨Åer‚Äôs outputs. Te\\\\nbagging method decreases the variance of the predictions\\\\nby generating additional data for training from the\\\\noriginal dataset. Te boosting method has two steps. Te\\\\nÔ¨Årst is using the original data to produce a series of\\\\naveragely performing models. Ten, the next step is to\\\\nincrease the performance by combining the previous\\\\nperformances using a voting scheme [10]. Using the\\\\nensemble technique, a weak classiÔ¨Åer can be converted to\\\\na strong classiÔ¨Åer. When working with a weak classiÔ¨Åer, it\\\\nis merged using the weighted average of the prediction\\\\naccuracy as metrics. Ten, the error will be propagated\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\n15\\\\nwith every prediction, and until the prediction becomes\\\\naccurate, multiple iterations will be carried out to reduce\\\\nthe error [59].\\\\nMaximum sensitivity neural networks use the back-\\\\npropagation algorithm to adjust the weights associated\\\\nwith the neurons. Tis is special as it saves time and\\\\nmemory while predicting more accurately as the output\\\\nlayer detects the maximum sensitivity of the neurons for\\\\nthe new pattern [47].\\\\nMachine learning feature extraction is the process that\\\\nhelps in identifying the relevant attributes from various\\\\ncandidate subnets, and it plays a vital role in creating an\\\\neÔ¨Äective predictive model. Tere are various beneÔ¨Åts of\\\\napplying feature selection, such as highly eÔ¨Äective and fast\\\\ntraining of the machine learning algorithm, reducing the\\\\ncomplexity of the model, improving the accuracy of the\\\\nmodel, and eliminating the overÔ¨Åtting problem. Tere are\\\\nthree groups that could be identiÔ¨Åed in feature selection\\\\nmethods. Tey are Ô¨Ålter, wrapper, and embedded methods.\\\\nTe Ô¨Ålter method is normally a preprocessing step that relies\\\\non general features. Te wrapper method uses machine\\\\nlearning in order to select the best and the most suited subset\\\\nof features. Forward feature selection, backward feature\\\\nelimination, and recursive feature elimination are widely\\\\nused wrapper methods. Te embedded method combines\\\\nthe qualities of the Ô¨Ålter and wrapper methods [17]. It is\\\\nimportant to remember that when features are correlated to\\\\nother features, there is no point having all of them con-\\\\nsidered in the machine learning algorithm as it will increase\\\\nonly the execution time but will not improve the eÔ¨Éciency of\\\\nthe algorithm. It is also to be noted that when adding certain\\\\nfeatures, the accuracy of the algorithm may drop. It is\\\\npreferred if each of the features could be tested individually\\\\nand then combined in a way that the accuracy of the output\\\\nwill be increased [27]. Te quality of the feature selection\\\\nprocess has a direct impact on the accuracy increase. Some\\\\nalgorithms like ANN show a higher increase in the accuracy\\\\nwhen compared with other algorithms after the feature\\\\nselection phase is performed [25].\\\\nMachine learning techniques have gained signiÔ¨Åcantly\\\\nhigh accuracy when considering classiÔ¨Åcation-based prob-\\\\nlems. A four-tier architecture can be used to store and\\\\nprocess a huge volume of data eÔ¨Éciently. Tier 1 can be used\\\\nto collect data, and tier 2 can be used to store huge volumes\\\\nof data. Tier 3 and tier 4 can be used for machine learning\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åcations and representation of the results, respectively\\\\n[14]. In the present time, as computing power is not an issue,\\\\nDNN has more than 20 layers. Early neural networks were\\\\ntypically less than 5 layers. DNNs are used for various\\\\npurposes such as automatic object detection, segmentation\\\\non images, automatic speech recognition, genotypic and\\\\nphenotypic detection, classiÔ¨Åcation of diseases in bio-\\\\ninformatics, and so on. Even though CNN is quite similar to\\\\nregular neural networks, it assumes that there are geometric\\\\nrelationships among inputs. By using convolutional layers in\\\\nDNN, important features could be ampliÔ¨Åed for better\\\\nanalysis. Te pooling layer in CNN takes the output and\\\\nÔ¨Ånds the maximal value so that it could give the convolution\\\\nfunction the best extracts of the images. Regularization is\\\\nused when training deep networks as it increases the per-\\\\nformance by reducing overÔ¨Åtting. Tere are no exact number\\\\nof layers to obtain more accurate results, but it is an iterative\\\\ntrial and error process in which the best architecture needs to\\\\nbe found for a speciÔ¨Åc problem. Te advantage of using CNN\\\\nover traditional machine learning algorithms is that there is\\\\nno need to compute the features as the Ô¨Årst step. But CNN\\\\nwill Ô¨Ånd the important features as a part of its searching\\\\nprocess [8].\\\\nAs ANN is complex, other simple machine learning\\\\nalgorithms such as SVM, KNN, and RF gradually came\\\\nahead of ANN in popularity. By selecting the appropriate\\\\nactivation functions, better feature extraction can be\\\\nachieved, as they are what form the nonlinear layers in deep\\\\nlearning frameworks. Tere are many activation functions.\\\\nSigmoid function, hyperbolic tangent, softmax, rectiÔ¨Åed\\\\nlinear unit (ReLU), softplus, absolute value rectiÔ¨Åcation, and\\\\nmaxout are a few of such commonly used activation\\\\nfunctions. Tere are various deep learning architectures such\\\\nas AE, DBN, restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM), CNN,\\\\nand RNN. AE is diÔ¨Äerent from ordinary ANN as it extracts\\\\nfeatures from unlabelled data and sets target values to be\\\\nequal to the inputs. RBMs are generative graphical models\\\\nand their aim is to learn the distribution of the training data.\\\\nDBM can be considered as a stack of AEs or RBMs. CNN is\\\\ndiÔ¨Äerent from other deep learning algorithms as it extracts\\\\nfeatures from small sections of an input image. RNN out-\\\\nperforms all the other deep learning approaches when it is\\\\nabout dealing with sequential data. Machine learning is\\\\nwidely used in the medical image domain. Sparse autoen-\\\\ncoder (SAE) and RBM can deal with dynamic data and they\\\\ncan also extract patterns from unlabelled data. Due to its\\\\ncapacity of analysing special data, CNN is used in biomedical\\\\nimage analysis commonly. When considering the challenges,\\\\nit is to note that in deep learning, it requires a large amount\\\\nof labelled data for model training. Another issue when\\\\nworking with biomedical data is that they are imbalanced, as\\\\nthe normal people set is much larger than the diagnosed\\\\npeople set. Tey also need high memory and high computing\\\\npower. Te input images must be in high resolution.\\\\nNowadays, there are various medical devices and sensors\\\\nwhich provide large amounts of data. Deep learning ap-\\\\nproaches are good interpreters of these data for disease\\\\nprediction, prevention, and diagnosis. Table 1 lists few ap-\\\\nplications of the above-discussed deep learning algorithms\\\\nin the Ô¨Åeld of biology and biomedicine [60].\\\\nAs per Table 2, there are several open-source machine\\\\nlearning libraries in various languages which could be used\\\\nto assist in the development process when implementing\\\\nintelligent biological applications. Python and C++ have the\\\\nmost number of libraries that support deep learning. But\\\\nPython is more often used in traditional machine learning\\\\napproaches [60]. Te popularity or the usage of various deep\\\\nlearning frameworks in projects, when categorized based on\\\\nthe language that they are written in, is shown in Figure 1.\\\\nAt the initial stage, simple machine learning classifying\\\\nand clustering algorithms were used in data processing and\\\\npredictions, but when moving forward, with the develop-\\\\nment\\\\nin\\\\ncomputational\\\\npower\\\\nand\\\\nprogramming\\\\n16\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\nmethodologies, more enhanced and complex machine\\\\nlearning algorithms were adapted by the Ô¨Åeld of biology and\\\\nbiomedicine to obtain more accurate results at a higher\\\\neÔ¨Éciency. Even at this very moment various attempts are\\\\nbeing executed to further evolve the computational biology\\\\nand biomedicine domain with the integration of sophisti-\\\\ncated scalable machine learning algorithms. Many languages\\\\nprovide multiple application program interfaces (APIs) and\\\\nlibraries in order to assist in these development processes so\\\\nthat the main concern or priority could be given to the\\\\nrequirement with regard to the subject matter and less at-\\\\ntention towards the eÔ¨Éciency and performance of the al-\\\\ngorithms, as they have already been handled by the libraries\\\\nor APIs. Tese algorithms could even be applied to diÔ¨Äerent\\\\ndomains such as marketing, social media, search engines,\\\\nfraud detection, stock market analysis, e-business, authen-\\\\ntication, and so on by changing the training datasets and the\\\\nfeatures to be analysed. But in this review paper, the\\\\ncomputational\\\\nbiology\\\\nand\\\\nbiomedicine\\\\ndomain\\\\nwas\\\\nconsidered.\\\\nWhen coming back to precision medicine, as discussed\\\\npreviously, the simplest deÔ¨Ånition that could be provided\\\\nwould be treating patients based on their genetic, lifestyle,\\\\nand environmental data. Tis is simply not an easy task. It\\\\nneeds to have a whole load of data that should be analysed to\\\\nobtain the required knowledge for it. Tis is near impossible\\\\nfor humans to manually process. Furthermore, some rela-\\\\ntionships among data cannot be identiÔ¨Åed by humans after\\\\nexploring the dataset. But as discussed previously, unsu-\\\\npervised machine learning has been able to capture these\\\\nrelationships and group data according to the identiÔ¨Åed\\\\nrelationships. As precision medicine studies are involved\\\\nwith genes, it is certain that the biomedical event extraction\\\\nwould also contribute towards it. For a patient to then be\\\\ntreated using precision medicine, few approaches in com-\\\\nputational biology are vital, such as biomedical data analysis,\\\\ndisease diagnosis, and medical image analysis. Te reason is\\\\nthat categorizing the patients to identify the treatment to be\\\\nfollowed according to a set of considered factors needs better\\\\nobservations of the patient and his/her medical history.\\\\nTable 1: Applications of deep learning algorithms in computational biology [60].\\\\nDeep learning\\\\nalgorithm\\\\nMedical image analysis\\\\nProtein structure prediction\\\\nGenomic sequencing and gene\\\\nexpression analysis\\\\nConvolutional\\\\nneural network\\\\nBrain tumour segmentation, knee\\\\ncartilage segmentation, prediction of\\\\nsemantic descriptions from medical\\\\nimages, segmentation of MR brain\\\\nimages, coronary artery calcium scoring\\\\nin CT images\\\\nPrediction of protein order/\\\\ndisorder regions, prediction of\\\\nprotein secondary structures,\\\\nprediction of protein structure\\\\nproperties\\\\n‚Äî\\\\nSparse\\\\nautoencoder\\\\nOrgan detection in 4D patient data,\\\\nsegmentation of hippocampus from\\\\ninfant brains, histological\\\\ncharacterization of healthy skin and\\\\nhealing wounds\\\\nSequence-based prediction of\\\\nbackbone CŒ± angles and dihedrals\\\\n‚Äî\\\\nDeep belief\\\\nnetwork\\\\nSegmentation of left ventricle of the heart\\\\nfrom MR data, discrimination of retinal-\\\\nbased diseases\\\\nPrediction of protein disorder,\\\\nprediction of secondary structures,\\\\nlocal backbone angles\\\\nModelling structural binding\\\\npreferences and predicting binding\\\\nsites of RNA-binding proteins,\\\\nprediction of splice junction at DNA\\\\nlevel\\\\nDeep neural\\\\nnetwork\\\\nBrain tumour segmentation in MR\\\\nimages, prostate MR segmentation, gland\\\\ninstance segmentation\\\\n‚Äî\\\\nGene expression inference,\\\\nprediction of enhancer, prediction of\\\\nsplicing patterns in individual tissues\\\\nand diÔ¨Äerences in splicing patterns\\\\nacross tissues\\\\nRecurrent neural\\\\nnetwork\\\\nClassiÔ¨Åcation of patterns of EEG\\\\nsynchronization for seizure prediction,\\\\nEEG-based lapse detection\\\\nPrediction of protein secondary\\\\nstructure, prediction of protein\\\\ncontact map\\\\nPrediction of miRNA precursor and\\\\nmiRNA targets, detection of splice\\\\njunctions from DNA sequences\\\\nTable 2: Machine learning libraries in languages [8].\\\\nLanguage\\\\nTraditional machine learning libraries\\\\nDeep neural network machine learning libraries\\\\nPython\\\\nScikit-learn, PyBrain, Nilearn, Pattern, MILK,\\\\nMixtend\\\\nKeras, TensorÔ¨Çow (written in both C++ and Python), Nolearn, DeePy,\\\\nPylearn2\\\\nR\\\\nCaret, Boruta, GMMBoost, H2O, KlaR,\\\\nrminer\\\\nDarch, DeepNet\\\\nC++\\\\nShogun\\\\nCaÔ¨Äe, EBLearn, Intel Deep learning Framework, TensorÔ¨Çow (written in both\\\\nC++ and Python)\\\\nJava\\\\nEncog, Spark, Mahout, MALLET, Weka\\\\nDeeplearning4j\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nCluster, LDA, Node-SVM\\\\nConvnetJS\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\n17\\\\nTroughout this paper, on many occasions, the in-\\\\nvolvement of machine learning in computational biology\\\\nand biomedicine has been discussed. Te reason behind it is\\\\nthat more than 80% of the healthcare decisions are made\\\\nbased on the said areas. In addition to it, data analytics is\\\\nbeing applied in the healthcare sector to improve the\\\\nhealthcare services by predicting the future expectations\\\\nbased on a patient\\'s medical history. Terefore, there is no\\\\ndoubt that prominent attention needs to be given towards\\\\nthe areas of computational biology and biomedicine when\\\\ndiscussing computational decision making in healthcare. But\\\\nit is to be highlighted that whenever we use an approach\\\\nrelated to artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence in healthcare, it is always\\\\nrelated to making a decision. Disease detection, disease\\\\nprediction, drug repurposing, precision medicine, medical\\\\nresource allocation, and much more can be shown as evi-\\\\ndence for it. In all of them, a machine learning algorithm\\\\neither makes a decision or least it would support a decision.\\\\nIt helps in solving a doubt that a clinician may have or\\\\nsometimes highlighting a fact which was not visible to the\\\\nclinician at the time of making a decision as a solution for a\\\\nhealthcare-related issue. In addition to it, most importantly,\\\\nit deals with people‚Äôs lives and even a simple mistake can\\\\nmake a huge impact on a person and even the society at\\\\nlarge. Terefore, computational decision making is so crucial\\\\nin the healthcare sector to make conÔ¨Ådent and accurate\\\\ndecisions in less time and at low cost. Tis has only been\\\\npossible with machine learning approaches being adapted as\\\\na tool in healthcare and is currently being extensively applied\\\\nin healthcare decisions.\\\\n10. Conclusion\\\\nWhile reaching the end of the paper, there is no doubt that\\\\nmachine learning algorithms, which is a subsection of ar-\\\\ntiÔ¨Åcial intelligence, have inspired the Ô¨Åeld of computational\\\\nbiology and have contributed immensely to the healthcare\\\\nsector in terms of fast, eÔ¨Écient, accurate, and cost-eÔ¨Äective\\\\ncomputational decision making. It is clearly visible that in\\\\nthe present context, machine learning has been applied in\\\\nvarious sections in the discussed Ô¨Åeld. Te involvement of\\\\nmachine learning can be found in disease diagnosis and\\\\nprediction, medical imaging, drug repurposing, biomedical\\\\nevent extraction, and much more in healthcare. But what is\\\\ncertain is that the journey that started with the integration of\\\\nmachine learning to computational biology has come a long\\\\nway passing several milestones and is now at a peak with the\\\\nintroduction of precision medicine. When considering all\\\\nthe above applications of machine learning in healthcare,\\\\nwhat is clearly visible is that how artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence has\\\\nbeen a key resource area for decision making in the\\\\nhealthcare sector in various aspects. When giving concern to\\\\nthe most recent applications of artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence in\\\\nhealthcare, the best example would be how diÔ¨Äerent tasks\\\\nsuch as patient care, treatment research, resource allocations\\\\nbased on the hospital volume, predictions and preparing for\\\\nfuture possible requirement, and so on were handled and\\\\nmanaged during the COVID-19 pandemic. With all that\\\\nbeing said, it is crystal clear that artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence had\\\\nplayed a huge role through machine learning to implement\\\\ncomputational decision making tools for the healthcare\\\\nsector, and in present times, they are of much importance\\\\nand could not be separated from the healthcare sector.\\\\nConflicts of Interest\\\\nTe authors declare that they have no conÔ¨Çicts of interest.\\\\nAcknowledgments\\\\nTe authors would like to specially thank the respective staÔ¨Ä\\\\nmembers in the Faculty of Information Technology of\\\\nUniversity of Moratuwa who guided and assisted them to\\\\nwrite this paper.\\\\nReferences\\\\n[1] S.

Hence, the \\\\norganizations associated with healthcare must attempt to \\\\nprocure all the available tools and infrastructure to make use \\\\nof the big data, which can augment the revenue and profits \\\\nand can establish better healthcare networks, and stand apart \\\\nto reap significant benefits [4, 5]. Data mining techniques \\\\ncan create a shift from conventional medical databases to a \\\\nknowledge-rich, evidence-based healthcare environment in \\\\nthe coming decade.\\\\nBig data and its utility in healthcare and medical sciences \\\\nhave become more critical with the dawn of the social media \\\\nera (platforms such as Facebook and Twitter) and smart-\\\\nphone apps that can monitor personal health parameters \\\\nusing sensors and analyzers [6, 7]. The role of data mining is \\\\nto improvise the stored user information to provide superior \\\\ntreatment and care. This review article provides an insight \\\\ninto the advantages and methodologies of big data usage \\\\nin health care systems. It highlights the voluminous data \\\\ngenerated in these systems, their qualities, possible security-\\\\nrelated problems, data handling, and how this analytics sup-\\\\nport gaining significant insight into these data set.\\\\nSearch strategy\\\\nA non-systematic review of all data science, big data in \\\\nhealthcare-related English language literature published in \\\\nthe last decade (2010‚Äì2020) was conducted in November \\\\n2020 using MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, and Google \\\\nScholar. Our search strategy involved creating a search \\\\nstring based on a combination of keywords. They were: ‚ÄúBig \\\\nData,‚Äù ‚ÄúBig Data Analytics,‚Äù ‚ÄúHealthcare,‚Äù ‚ÄúArtificial Intel-\\\\nligence,‚Äù ‚ÄúAI,‚Äù ‚ÄúMachine learning,‚Äù ‚ÄúML,‚Äù ‚ÄúANN,‚Äù ‚ÄúCon-\\\\nvolutional Networks,‚Äù ‚ÄúElectronic Health Records,‚Äù ‚ÄúEHR,‚Äù \\\\n‚ÄúEMR,‚Äù ‚ÄúBioinformatics,‚Äù and ‚ÄúData Science.‚Äù We included \\\\noriginal articles published in English.\\\\nInclusion criteria\\\\n1.\\\\t Articles on big data analytics, data science, and AI.\\\\n2.\\\\t Full-text original articles on all aspects of application of \\\\ndata science in medical sciences.\\\\nExclusion criteria\\\\n1.\\\\t Commentaries, reviews, and articles with no full-text \\\\ncontext and book chapters.\\\\n2.\\\\t Animal, laboratory, or cadaveric studies.\\\\nThe literature review was performed as per the above-\\\\nmentioned strategy. The evaluation of titles and abstracts, \\\\nscreening, and the full article text was conducted for the \\\\nchosen articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Further-\\\\nmore, the authors manually reviewed the selected article‚Äôs \\\\nreferences list to screen for any additional work of interest. \\\\nThe authors resolved the disagreements about eligibility for \\\\na consensus decision after discussion.\\\\nKnowing more about\\xa0‚Äúbig data‚Äù\\\\nBig data consists of vast volumes of data, which cannot \\\\nbe managed using conventional technologies. Although \\\\nthere are many ways to define big data, we can consider \\\\nthe one defined by Douglas Laney [8] that represents three \\\\ndimensions, namely, volume, velocity, and variety (3 Vs). \\\\nThe ‚Äúbig‚Äù in big data implies its large volume. Velocity \\\\ndemonstrates the speed or rate at which data is processed. \\\\nVariety focuses on the various forms of structured and raw \\\\ndata obtained by any method or device, such as transaction-\\\\nlevel data, videos, audios, texts, emails, and logs. The 3 Vs \\\\nbecame the default description of big data, while many other \\\\nVs are added to the definition [9]. ‚ÄúVeracity‚Äù remains the \\\\nmost agreed 4th ‚ÄúV.‚Äù Data veracity focuses on the accuracy \\\\nand reliability of a dataset. It helps to filter through what is \\\\nimportant and what is not. The data with high veracity has \\\\nmany records that are valuable to analyze and that contribute \\\\nin a meaningful way to the overall results. This aspect poses \\\\nthe biggest challenge when it comes to big data. With so \\\\nmuch data available, ensuring that it is relevant and of high \\\\nquality is important. Over recent years, big data has become \\\\nincreasingly popular across all parts of the globe.\\\\nBig data needs technologically sophisticated applications \\\\nthat use high-end computing resources and Artificial Intel-\\\\nligence (AI)-based algorithms to understand such huge vol-\\\\numes of data. Machine learning (ML) approaches for auto-\\\\nmatic decision-making by applying fuzzy logic and neural \\\\nnetworks will be added advantage. Innovative and efficient \\\\nstrategies for dealing with data, smart cloud-based applica-\\\\ntions, effective storage, and user-friendly visualization are \\\\nrequired for big data to gain practical insights [10].\\\\nMedical care as\\xa0a\\xa0repository for\\xa0big data\\\\nHealthcare is a multilayered system developed specifically \\\\nfor preventing, diagnosing, and treating diseases. The key \\\\nelements of medical care are health practitioners (physicians \\\\nand nurses), healthcare facilities (which include clinics, drug \\\\ndelivery centers, and other testing or treatment technolo-\\\\ngies), and a funding agency that funds the former. Health \\\\ncare practitioners belong to different fields of health such as \\\\ndentistry, pharmacy, medicine, nursing, psychology, allied \\\\nhealth sciences, and many more. Depending on the sever-\\\\nity of the cases, health care is provided at many levels. In \\\\n1474\\\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\\\n1 3\\\\nall these stages, health practitioners need different forms of \\\\ninformation such as the medical history of the patient (data \\\\nrelated to medication and prescriptions), clinical data (such \\\\nas data from laboratory assessments), and other personal or \\\\nprivate medical data. The usual practice for a clinic, hospi-\\\\ntal, or patient to retain these medical documents would be \\\\nmaintaining either written notes or in the form of printed \\\\nreports [11].\\\\nThe clinical case records preserve the incidence and out-\\\\ncome of disease in a person‚Äôs body as a tale in the family, \\\\nand the doctor plays an integral role in this tale [12]. With \\\\nthe emergence of electronic systems and their capacity, digi-\\\\ntizing medical exams, health records, and investigations is \\\\na common procedure today. In 2003, the Institute of Medi-\\\\ncine, a division in the National Academies of Sciences and \\\\nEngineering coined the term ‚ÄúElectronic Health Records‚Äù \\\\nfor representing an electronic portal that saves the records of \\\\nthe patients. Electronic health records (EHRs) are automated \\\\nmedical records of patients related to an individual‚Äôs physi-\\\\ncal/mental health or significant reports that are saved in an \\\\nelectronic system and used to record, send, receive, store, \\\\nretrieve, and connect the medical personnel and patient with \\\\nmedical services [13].\\\\nOpen‚Äësource big data platforms\\\\nIt is an inefficient idea to work with big data or vast vol-\\\\numes of data into storage considering even the most power-\\\\nful computers. Hence, the only logical approach to process \\\\nlarge quantities of big data available in a complex form is \\\\nby spreading and processing it on several parallel connected \\\\nnodes. Nevertheless, the volume of the data is typically so \\\\nhigh that a large number of computing machines are needed \\\\nin a reasonable period to distribute and finish processing. \\\\nWorking with thousands of nodes involves coping with \\\\nissues related to paralleling the computation, spreading \\\\nof data, and manage failures. Table\\xa01 shows the few open \\\\nsources of big data platforms and their utilities for data \\\\nscientists.\\\\nData mining\\\\nData types can be classified based on their nature, source, \\\\nand data collection methods [14]. Data mining techniques \\\\ninclude data grouping, data clustering, data correlation, and \\\\nmining of sequential patterns, regression, and data storage. \\\\nThere are several sources to obtain healthcare-related data \\\\n(Fig.\\xa01). The most commonly used type (77%) is the data \\\\nTable\\u202f1\\u2002 \\u2009Open  source big data platforms and their utilities\\\\nBig data tools\\\\nUtilities\\\\nApache Hadoop\\\\nIt is designed to scale up to thousands of machines from single servers, each of which offers local storage\\\\nThe framework enables users to easily build and validate distributed structures, distributes data, and operates across \\\\nmachines automatically\\\\nApache Spark\\\\nThe Hadoop Distributed File system (HDFS) and other data stores are flexible to work with\\\\nSpark offers integrated Application Program Interfaces (APIs) which enable users to write apps in different languages\\\\nApache Cassandra\\\\nCassandra is highly flexible and can add additional hardware that can handle more data and users on demand\\\\nCassandra adapts to all possible data types such as unstructured, structured, and semi-structured supporting features such as \\\\nAtomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID)\\\\nApache Storm\\\\nIn several cases, Apache Storm is easy to integrate with any programming language, with real-time analytics, online \\\\nmachine learning, and computation\\\\nApache Storm uses parallel calculations which run across a machine cluster\\\\nRapidMiner\\\\nRapidMiner provides a variety of products for a new process of data mining\\\\nIt provides an integrated data preparation environment, machine learning, text mining, visualization, predictive analysis, \\\\napplication development, prototype validation, and implementation. statistic modeling, deployment\\\\nCloudera\\\\nUsers can spin clusters, terminate them, and only pay for what they need\\\\nCloudera Enterprise can be deployed and run on AWS and Google Cloud Platforms by users\\\\nFig.\\u202f1\\u2002 \\u2009Sources of big data in healthcare\\\\n1475\\\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\\\n1 3\\\\ngenerated by humans (HG data) which includes Electronic \\\\nMedical Records (EMR), Electronic Health Records (EHR), \\\\nand Electronic Patient Records (EPR). Online data through \\\\nWeb Service (WS) is considered as the second largest form \\\\nof data (11%) due to the increase in the number of people \\\\nusing social media day by day and current digital develop-\\\\nment in the medical sector [15]. Recent advances in the \\\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)-based methodologies \\\\nare also making WS simpler to use [16]. The other data \\\\nforms such as Sensor Data (SD), Big Transactional Data \\\\n(BTD), and Biometric Data (BM) make around 12% of \\\\noverall data use, but wearable personal health monitoring \\\\ndevices‚Äô prominence and market growth [17] may need SD \\\\nand BM data.\\\\nApplications of\\xa0analytics in\\xa0healthcare\\\\nThere are six areas of applications of analytics in healthcare \\\\n(Fig.\\xa02) including disease surveillance, health care manage-\\\\nment and administration, privacy protection and fraud detec-\\\\ntion, mental health, public health, and pharmacovigilance. \\\\nResearchers have implemented data extraction for data \\\\ndeposition and cloud-based computing, optimizing quality, \\\\nlowering costs, leveraging resources, handling patients, and \\\\nother fields.\\\\nDisease surveillance\\\\nIt involves the perception of the disease, understanding its \\\\ncondition, etiology (the manner of causation of a disease), \\\\nand prevention (Fig.\\xa03).\\\\nInformation obtained with the help of EHRs, and the \\\\nInternet has a huge prospect for disease analysis. The various \\\\nsurveillance methods would aid the planning of services, \\\\nevaluation of treatments, priority setting, and the develop-\\\\nment of health policy and practice.\\\\nImage processing of\\xa0healthcare data \\\\nfrom\\xa0the\\xa0big data point of\\xa0view\\\\nImage processing on healthcare data offers valuable knowl-\\\\nedge about anatomy and organ functioning and identifies \\\\nthe disease and patient health conditions. The technique \\\\ncurrently has been used for organ delineation, identification \\\\nof lung tumors, diagnosis of spinal deformity, detection of \\\\narterial stenosis, detection of an aneurysm, etc. [18]. The \\\\nwavelets technique is commonly used for image process-\\\\ning techniques such as segmentation, enhancement, and \\\\nnoise reduction. The use of artificial intelligence in image \\\\nprocessing will enhance aspects of health care including \\\\nscreening, diagnosis, and prognosis, and integrating medi-\\\\ncal images with other types of data and genomic data will \\\\nincrease accuracy and facilitate early diagnosis of diseases \\\\n[18, 19]. The exponential increase in the count of medical \\\\nfacilities and patients has led to better use of clinical set-\\\\ntings of computer-based healthcare diagnostics and decision-\\\\nmaking systems.\\\\nData from\\xa0wearable technology\\\\nMulti-National Companies like Apple and Google are \\\\nworking on health-based apps and wearable technology as \\\\npart of a broader range of electronic sensors, the so-called \\\\nFig.\\u202f2\\u2002 \\u2009Various applications of data science in healthcare\\\\nFig.\\u202f3\\u2002 \\u2009The disease analysis system\\\\n1476\\\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\\\n1 3\\\\nIoT, and toolkits for healthcare-related apps. The pos-\\\\nsibility of collecting accurate medical data on real-time \\\\n(e.g., mood, diet followed, exercise, and sleep cycles pat-\\\\nterns), linked to physiological indicators (e.g., heart rate, \\\\ncalories burned, level of blood glucose, cortisol levels), is \\\\nperhaps discrete and omnipresent at minimum cost, unre-\\\\nlated to traditional health care. ‚ÄúTrue Colors‚Äù is a wear-\\\\nable designed to collect continuous patient-centric data \\\\nwith the accessibility and acceptability needed to allow \\\\nfor accurate longitudinal follow-up. More importantly, \\\\nthis system is presently being piloted as a daily health-\\\\nmonitoring substitute.\\\\nMedical signal analytics\\\\nTelemetry and the devices for the monitoring of physi-\\\\nological parameters generate large amounts of data. The \\\\ndata generated generally are retained for a shorter dura-\\\\ntion, and thus, extensive research into produced data is \\\\nneglected. However, advancements in data science in the \\\\nfield of healthcare attempt to ensure better management of \\\\ndata and provide enhanced patient care [20‚Äì23].\\\\nThe use of continuous waveform in health records con-\\\\ntaining information generated through the application of \\\\nstatistical disciplines (e.g., statistical, quantitative, con-\\\\ntextual, cognitive, predictive, etc.) can drive comprehen-\\\\nsive care decision-making. Data acquisition apart from an \\\\ningestion-streaming platform is needed that can control a \\\\nset of waveforms at various fidelity rates. The integration \\\\nof this waveform data with the EHR‚Äôs static data results in \\\\nan important component for giving analytics engine situ-\\\\national as well as contextual awareness. Enhancing the \\\\ndata collected by analytics will not just make the method \\\\nmore reliable, but will also help in balancing predictive \\\\nanalytics‚Äô sensitivity and specificity. The signal processing \\\\nspecies must mainly rely on the kind of disease population \\\\nunder observation.\\\\nVarious signal-processing techniques can be used to \\\\nderive a large number of target properties that are later \\\\nconsumed to provide actionable insight by a pre-trained \\\\nmachine-learning model. Such observations may be ana-\\\\nlytical, prescriptive, or predictive. Such insights can be \\\\nfurthermore built to activate other techniques such as \\\\nalarms and physician notifications. Maintaining these con-\\\\ntinuous waveforms‚Äìbased data along with specific data \\\\nobtained from the remaining sources in perfect harmony \\\\nto find the appropriate patient information to improve \\\\ndiagnosis and treatments of the next generation can be \\\\na daunting task [24]. Several technological criteria and \\\\nspecifications at the framework, analytical, and clinical \\\\nlevels need to be planned and implemented for the bedside \\\\nimplementation of these systems into medical setups.\\\\nHealthcare administration\\\\nKnowledge obtained from big data analysis gives health-\\\\ncare providers insights not available otherwise (Fig.\\xa04). \\\\nResearchers have implemented data mining techniques to \\\\ndata warehousing as well as cloud computing, increasing \\\\nquality, minimizing costs, handling patients, and several \\\\nother fields of healthcare.\\\\nData storage and\\xa0cloud computing\\\\nData warehousing and cloud storage are primarily used for \\\\nstoring the increasing amount of electronic patient-centric \\\\ndata [25, 26] safely and cost-effectively to enhance medical \\\\noutcomes. Besides medical purposes, data storage is utilized \\\\nfor purposes of research, training, education, and quality \\\\ncontrol. Users can also extract files from a repository con-\\\\ntaining the radiology results by using keywords following \\\\nthe predefined patient privacy policy.\\\\nCost and\\xa0quality of\\xa0healthcare and\\xa0utilization \\\\nof\\xa0resources\\\\nThe migration of imaging reports to electronic medical \\\\nrecording systems offers tremendous potential for advancing \\\\nresearch and practice on radiology through the continuous \\\\nupdating, incorporation, and exchange of a large volume of \\\\ndata. However, the heterogeneity in how these data can be \\\\nformatted still poses major challenges. The overall objec-\\\\ntive of NLP is that the natural human language is translated \\\\ninto structured with a standardized set of value choices that \\\\nare easily manipulated into subsections or searches for the \\\\npresence or absence of a finding through software, among \\\\nother things [27].\\\\nGreaves et\\xa0al. [28] analyzed sentiment (computationally \\\\ndividing them into categories such as optimistic, pessimis-\\\\ntic, and neutral) based on the online response of patients \\\\nFig.\\u202f4\\u2002 \\u2009Role of big data in accelerating the treatment process\\\\n1477\\\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\\\n1 3\\\\nstating their overall experience to predict healthcare qual-\\\\nity. They found an agreement above 80% between online \\\\nplatform sentiment analysis and conventional paper-based \\\\nquality prediction surveys (e.g., cleanliness, positive con-\\\\nduct, recommendation). The newer solution can be a cost-\\\\neffective alternative to conventional healthcare surveys and \\\\nstudies. The physician‚Äôs overuse of screening and testing \\\\noften leads to surplus data and excess costs [29]. The present \\\\npractice in pathology is restricted by the emphasis on illness. \\\\nZhuang et\\xa0al. [29] compared the disease-based approach in \\\\nconjunction with database reasoning and used the data min-\\\\ning technique to build a decision support system based on \\\\nevidence to minimize the unnecessary testing to reduce the \\\\ntotal expense of patient care.\\\\nPatient data management\\\\nPatient data management involves effective scheduling and \\\\nthe delivery of patient care during the period of a patient‚Äôs \\\\nstay in a hospital. The framework of patient-centric health-\\\\ncare is shown in Fig.\\xa05. Daggy et\\xa0al. [30] conducted a study \\\\non ‚Äúno shows‚Äù or missing appointments that lead to the clini-\\\\ncal capability that has been underused. A logistical regres-\\\\nsion model is developed using electronic medical records to \\\\nestimate the probabilities of patients to no-show and show \\\\nthe use of estimates for creating clinical schedules that opti-\\\\nmize clinical capacity use while retaining limited waiting \\\\ntimes and clinical extra-time. The 400-day clinical call-in \\\\nprocess was simulated, and two timetables were developed \\\\nper day: the conventional method, which assigns one patient \\\\nper appointment slot, and the proposed method, which \\\\nschedules patients to balance patient waiting time, additional \\\\ntime, and income according to no-show likelihood.\\\\nIf patient no-show models are mixed with advanced pro-\\\\ngramming approaches, more patients can be seen a day thus \\\\nenhancing clinical performance. The advantages of imple-\\\\nmentation of planning software, including certain method-\\\\nologies, should be considered by clinics as regards no-show \\\\ncosts [30].\\\\nA study conducted by Cubillas et\\xa0al. [31] pointed out \\\\nthat it takes less time for patients who came for adminis-\\\\ntrative purposes than for patients for health reasons. They \\\\nalso developed a statistical design for estimating the num-\\\\nber of administrative visits. With a time saving of 21.73% \\\\n(660,538\\xa0min), their model enhanced the scheduling sys-\\\\ntem. Unlike administrative data/target finding patients, a few \\\\ncome very regularly for their medical treatment and cover a \\\\nsignificant amount of medical workload. Koskela et\\xa0al. [32] \\\\nused both supervised and unsupervised learning strategies \\\\nto identify and cluster records; the supervised strategy per-\\\\nformed well in one cluster with 86% accuracy in distinguish-\\\\ning fare documents from the incorrect ones, whereas the \\\\nunsupervised technique failed. This approach can be applied \\\\nto the semi-automate EMR entry system [32].\\\\nPrivacy of\\xa0medical data and\\xa0fraudulency \\\\ndetection\\\\nThe anonymization of patient data, maintaining the privacy \\\\nof the medical data and fraudulency detection in health-\\\\ncare, is crucial. This demands efforts from data scientists \\\\nto protect the big data from hackers. Mohammed et\\xa0al. [33] \\\\nintroduced a unique anonymization algorithm that works \\\\nfor both distributed and centralized anonymization and dis-\\\\ncussed the problems of privacy security. For maintaining \\\\ndata usefulness without the loss of any data privacy, the \\\\nresearchers further proposed a model that performed far bet-\\\\nter than the traditional K-anonymization model. In addition \\\\nto this, their algorithm could also deal with voluminous, \\\\nmulti-dimensional datasets.\\\\nA mobile-based cloud-computing framework [34] of big \\\\ndata has been introduced to overcome the shortcomings of \\\\ntoday‚Äôs medical records systems. EHR data systems are \\\\nconstrained due to a lack of interoperability, size of data, \\\\nand privacy. This unique cloud-based system proposed to \\\\nstore EHR data from multiple healthcare providers within \\\\nFig.\\u202f5\\u2002 \\u2009Elemental structure of patient-centric healthcare and ecosys-\\\\ntem\\\\n1478\\\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\\\n1 3\\\\nthe facility of an internet provider to provide authorized \\\\nrestricted access to healthcare providers and patients. They \\\\nused algorithms for encryption, One Time Password (OTP), \\\\nor a 2-factor authentication to ensure data security.\\\\nThe analytics of the big data can be performed using \\\\nGoogle‚Äôs efficient tools such as big query tools and MapRe-\\\\nduce. This approach will reduce costs, improve efficiency, \\\\nand provide data protection compared to conventional tech-\\\\nniques that are used for anonymization. The conventional \\\\napproach generally leaves data open to re-identification. \\\\nLi et\\xa0al. in a case study showed that hacking can make a \\\\nconnection between tiny chunks of information as well as \\\\nrecognize patients [35]. Fraud detection and abuse (i.e., sus-\\\\npicious care behavior, deliberate act of falsely representing \\\\nfacts, and unwanted repeated visits) make excellent use of \\\\nbig data analytics [36].\\\\nBy using data from gynecology-based reports, Yang et\\xa0al. \\\\nframed a system that manually distinguishes characteristics \\\\nof suspicious specimens from a set of medical care plans \\\\nthat any doctor would mostly adopt [37]. The technique was \\\\nimplemented on the data from Taiwan‚Äôs Bureau of National \\\\nHealth Insurance (BNHI), where the proposed technique \\\\nmanaged to detect 69% of the total cases as fraudulent, \\\\nenhancing the current model, which detected only 63% of \\\\nfraudulent cases. To sum up, the protection of patient data \\\\nand the detection of fraud are of significant concern due \\\\nto the growing usage of social media technology and the \\\\npropensity of people to place personal information on these \\\\nplatforms. The already existing strategies for anonymizing \\\\nthe data may become less successful if they are not imple-\\\\nmented because a significant section of the personal details \\\\nof everyone is now accessible through these platforms.\\\\nMental health\\\\nAccording to National Survey conducted on Drug Use \\\\nand Health (NSDUH), 52.2% of the total population in the \\\\nUnited States (U.S.) was affected by either mental problems \\\\nor drug addiction/abuse [38]. In addition, approximately 30 \\\\nmillion suffer from panic attacks and anxiety disorders [39].\\\\nPanagiotakopoulos et\\xa0al. [40] developed a data analy-\\\\nsis‚Äìfocused treatment technique to help doctors in manag-\\\\ning patients with anxiety disorders. The authors used static \\\\ninformation that includes personal information such as the \\\\nage of the individual, sex, body and skin types, and family \\\\ndetails and dynamic information like the context of stress, \\\\nclimate, and symptoms to construct static and dynamic \\\\ninformation based on user models. For the first three ser-\\\\nvices, relationships between different complex parameters \\\\nwere established, and the remaining one was mainly used to \\\\npredict stress rates under various scenarios. This model was \\\\nverified with the help of data collected from twenty-seven \\\\nvolunteers who are selected via the anxiety assessment sur-\\\\nvey. The applications of data analytics in the disease diag-\\\\nnosis, examination, or treatment of patients with mental \\\\nwellbeing are very different from using analytics to antici-\\\\npate cancer or diabetes. In this case, the data context (static, \\\\ndynamic, or non-observable environment) seems to be more \\\\nimportant compared to data volume [39].\\\\nThe leading cause of perinatal morbidity and death is \\\\npremature birth, but an exact mechanism is still unclear. The \\\\nresearch carried by Chen et\\xa0al. [41] intended to investigate \\\\nthe risk factors of preterm use of neural networks and deci-\\\\nsion tree C5.0 data mining. The original medical data was \\\\nobtained by a specialist study group at the National Uni-\\\\nversity of Taiwan from a prospective pregnancy cohort. A \\\\ntotal of 910 mother‚Äìchild dyads from 14,551 in the original \\\\ndata have been recruited using the nest case‚Äìcontrol design. \\\\nIn this data, thousands of variables are studied, including \\\\nbasic features, medical background, the climate and parents‚Äô \\\\noccupational factors, and the variables related to children. \\\\nThe findings suggest that the main risk factors for pre-born \\\\nbirth are multiple births, blood pressure during pregnancy, \\\\nage, disease, prior preterm history, body weight and height \\\\nof pregnant women, and paternal life risks associated with \\\\ndrinking and smoking. The results of the study are there-\\\\nfore helpful in the attempt to diagnose high-risk pregnant \\\\nwomen and to provide intervention early to minimize and \\\\navoid early births in parents, healthcare workers, and public \\\\nhealth workers [41, 42].\\\\nPublic health\\\\nData analytics have also been applied to the detection of dis-\\\\nease during outbreaks. Kostkova et\\xa0al. [43] analyzed online \\\\nrecords based on behavior patterns and media reporting the \\\\nfactors that affect the public as well as professional patterns \\\\nof search-related disease outbreaks. They found distinct fac-\\\\ntors affecting the public health agencies‚Äô skilled and layper-\\\\nson search patterns with indications for targeted communica-\\\\ntions during emergencies and outbreaks. Rathore et\\xa0al. [44] \\\\nhave suggested an emergency tackling response unit using \\\\nIoT-based wireless network of wearable devices called body \\\\narea networks (BANs). The device consists of ‚Äúintelligent \\\\nconstruction,‚Äù a model that helps in processing and decision \\\\nmaking from the data obtained from the sensors. The system \\\\nwas able to process millions of users‚Äô wireless BAN data to \\\\nprovide an emergency response in real-time.\\\\nConsultation online is becoming increasingly common \\\\nand a possible solution to the scarcity of healthcare resources \\\\nand inefficient delivery of resources. Numerous online con-\\\\nsultation sites do however struggle to attract customers who \\\\nare prepared to pay and maintain them, and health care pro-\\\\nviders on the site have the additional challenge to stand out \\\\n1479\\\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\\\n1 3\\\\nfrom a large number of doctors who can provide similar \\\\nservices [45]. In this research, Jiang et\\xa0al. [45] used ML \\\\napproaches to mine massive service data, in order (1) to \\\\ndefine the important characteristics related to patient pay-\\\\nment rather than free trial appointments, (2) explore the rela-\\\\ntive importance of those features, and (3) understand how \\\\nthese attributes work concerning payment, whether linearly \\\\nor not. The dataset refers to the largest online medical con-\\\\nsultation platform in China, covering 1,582,564 consulta-\\\\ntion documents among patient pairs between 2009 and 2018. \\\\nThe results showed that compared with features relating to \\\\nreputation as a physician, service-related features such as \\\\nquality of service (e.g., intensity of consultation dialogue \\\\nand response rate), the source of patients (e.g., online vs \\\\noffline patients), and the involvement of patients (e.g., social \\\\nreturns and previous treatments revealed). To facilitate pay-\\\\nment, it is important to promote multiple timely responses \\\\nin patient-provider interactions.\\\\nPharmacovigilance\\\\nPharmacovigilance requires tracking and identification of \\\\nadverse drug reactions (ADRs) after launch, to guarantee \\\\npatient safety. ADR events‚Äô approximate social cost per year \\\\nreaches a billion dollars, showing it as a significant aspect \\\\nof the medical care system [46]. Data mining findings from \\\\nadverse event reports (AERs) revealed that mild to lethal \\\\nreactions might be caused in paclitaxel among which doc-\\\\netaxel is linked with the lethal reaction while the remain-\\\\ning 4 drugs were not associated with hypersensitivity [47] \\\\nwhile testing ADR‚Äôs ‚Äúhypersensitivity‚Äù to six anticancer \\\\nagents [47]. Harpaz et\\xa0al. [46] disagreed with the theory \\\\nthat adverse events might be caused not just due to a single \\\\nmedication but also due to a mixture of synthetic drugs. It \\\\nis found that there is a correlation between a minimum of \\\\none drug and two AEs or two drugs and one AE in 84% \\\\nof AERs studies. Harpaz R et\\xa0al. [47] improved precision \\\\nin the identification of ADRs by jointly considering sev-\\\\neral data sources. When using EHRs that are available pub-\\\\nlicly in conjunction with the AER studies of the FDA, they \\\\nachieved a 31% (on average) increase in detection [45]. The \\\\nauthors identified dose-dependent ADRs with the help of \\\\nmodels built from structured as well as unstructured EHR \\\\ndata [48]. Of the top 5 ADR-related drugs, 4 were observed \\\\nto be dose-related [49]. The use of text data that is unstruc-\\\\ntured in EHRs [50]; pharmacovigilance operation was also \\\\ngiven priority.\\\\nADRs are uncommon in conventional pharmacovigi-\\\\nlance, though it is possible to get false signals while finding \\\\na connection between a drug and any potential ADRs. These \\\\nfalse alarms can be avoided because there is already a list of \\\\npotential ADRs that can be of great help in potential phar-\\\\nmacovigilance activities [18].\\\\nOvercoming the\\xa0language barrier\\\\nHaving electronic health records shared worldwide can be \\\\nbeneficial in analyzing and comparing disease incidence and \\\\ntreatments in different countries. However, every country \\\\nwould use their language for data recording. This language \\\\nbarrier can be dealt with the help of multilingual language \\\\nmodels, which would allow diversified opportunities for \\\\nData Science proliferation and to develop a model for per-\\\\nsonalization of services. These models will be able to under-\\\\nstand the semantics ‚Äî the grammatical structure and rules \\\\nof the language along with the context ‚Äî the general under-\\\\nstanding of words in different contexts.\\\\nFor example: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll meet you at the river bank.‚Äù\\\\n‚ÄúI have to deposit some money in my bank account.‚Äù\\\\nThe word bank means different things in the two contexts, \\\\nand a well-trained language model should be able to dif-\\\\nferentiate between these two. Cross-lingual language model \\\\ntrains on multiple languages simultaneously. Some of the \\\\ncross lingual language models include:\\\\nmBERT ‚Äî the multilingual BERT which was developed \\\\nby Google Research team.\\\\nXLM ‚Äî cross lingual model developed by Facebook AI, \\\\nwhich is an improvisation over mBERT.\\\\nMultifit ‚Äî a QRNN-based model developed by Fast.Ai \\\\nthat addresses challenges faced by low resource language \\\\nmodels.\\\\nChallenges\\\\nMillions of data points are accessible for EHR-based pheno-\\\\ntyping involving a large number of clinical elements inside \\\\nthe EHRs. Like sequence data, handling and controlling the \\\\ncomplete data of millions of individuals would also become \\\\na major challenge [51]. The key challenges faced include:\\\\n‚Ä¢\\\\t The data collected was mostly either unorganized or inac-\\\\ncurate, thus posing a problem to gain insights into it.\\\\n‚Ä¢\\\\t The correct balance between preserving patient-centric \\\\ninformation and ensuring the quality and accessibility of \\\\nthis data is difficult to decide.\\\\n‚Ä¢\\\\t Data standardization, maintaining privacy, efficient stor-\\\\nage, and transfers require a lot of manpower to constantly \\\\nmonitor and make sure that the needs are met.\\\\n‚Ä¢\\\\t Integrating genomic data into medical studies is criti-\\\\ncal due to the absence of standards for producing \\\\nnext-generation sequencing (NGS) data, handling bio-\\\\n1480\\\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\\\n1 3\\\\ninformatics, data deposition, and supporting medical \\\\ndecision-making [52].\\\\n‚Ä¢\\\\t Language barrier when dealing data\\\\nFuture directions\\\\nHealthcare services are constantly on the lookout for bet-\\\\nter options for improving the quality of treatment. It has \\\\nembraced technological innovations intending to develop \\\\nfor a better future. Big data is a revolution in the world of \\\\nhealth care. The attitude of patients, doctors, and health-\\\\ncare providers to care delivery has only just begun to \\\\ntransform. The discussed use of big data is just the ice-\\\\nberg edge. With the proliferation of data science and the \\\\nadvent of various data-driven applications, the health sec-\\\\ntor remains a leading provider of data-driven solutions to \\\\na better life and tailored services to its customers. Data \\\\nscientists can gain meaningful insights into improving \\\\nthe productivity of pharmaceutical and medical services \\\\nthrough their broad range of data on the healthcare sec-\\\\ntor including financial, clinical, R&D, administration, and \\\\noperational details.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nLarger patient datasets can be obtained from medical \\\\ncare organizations that include data from surveillance, \\\\nlaboratory, genomics, imaging, and electronic healthcare \\\\nrecords. This data requires proper management and analy-\\\\nsis to derive meaningful information. Long-term visions \\\\nfor self-management, improved patient care, and treat-\\\\nment can be realized by utilizing big data. Data Science \\\\ncan bring in instant predictive analytics that can be used \\\\nto obtain insights into a variety of disease processes and \\\\ndeliver patient-centric treatment. It will help to improvise \\\\nthe ability of researchers in the field of science, epide-\\\\nmiological studies, personalized medicine, etc. Predictive \\\\naccuracy, however, is highly dependent on efficient data \\\\nintegration obtained from different sources to enable it to be \\\\ngeneralized. Modern health organizations can revolutionize \\\\nmedical therapy and personalized medicine by integrating \\\\nbiomedical and health data. Data science can effectively \\\\nhandle, evaluate, and interpret big data by creating new \\\\npaths in comprehensive medical care.\\\\nFunding\\u2002 Open access funding provided by Manipal Academy of Higher \\\\n \\\\nEducation, Manipal.\\\\nDeclarations\\u2002\\\\nConflict of interest\\u2002 The authors declare no competing interests.\\\\nOpen Access\\u2002 This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attri-\\\\nbution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adapta-\\\\ntion, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long \\\\nas you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, \\\\nprovide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes \\\\nwere made.

The services provided during HHC include skilled \\\\nnursing care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and social work.2 As \\\\npart of routine HHC visits, clinicians assess for early signs of deterioration to reduce the \\\\nrisk of adverse events.3 Despite comprehensive assessments and interventions, nearly one \\\\nin five patients are hospitalized or visit the emergency department (ED) during the time \\\\nthey receive HHC services.4‚Äì6 Other initiatives aimed at hospitalization reduction include \\\\nfinancial incentives;4 however, readmission rates have not improved.7 Estimates show that \\\\napproximately 40% of hospitalizations and ED visits are due to preventable ambulatory \\\\ncare-sensitive conditions8 that could be avoided with timely and tailored interventions.9\\\\nIn recent years, there has been growing evidence that machine learning algorithms can \\\\npredict the risk of deterioration in patients by analyzing electronic health record (EHR) \\\\ndocumentation.10 HHC agencies have their own EHR which provides a central place to \\\\nHobensack et al.\\\\nPage 2\\\\nInt J Med Inform. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nstore information describing patients‚Äô diagnosis, problems, interventions, and outcomes. In \\\\nHHC, nurses are the largest group of clinicians, hence nursing documentation accounts \\\\nfor a majority of EHR documentation. Other users of the EHR in HHC include physical, \\\\noccupational, and speech therapists, and social workers.11 Machine learning algorithms can \\\\nidentify patients who may experience an adverse event by discovering patterns in previously \\\\ndocumented data.12 The value of machine learning has been demonstrated in the acute care \\\\nsetting to detect various adverse events13,14 such as mortality15 and the activation of rapid \\\\nresponse teams.16 This has led to the development of clinical decision support systems that \\\\nproactively notify clinicians to patients at risk for experiencing an adverse outcome.17,18 \\\\nHowever, the extent to which machine learning has been applied in the HHC setting for risk \\\\nprediction has not been previously reported.\\\\nAnother consideration when assessing the value of machine learning is understanding the \\\\npredictors driving the algorithm. Previous studies have demonstrated the versatility of \\\\nusing machine learning to examine a wide range of predictors from symptoms to social \\\\ndeterminants of health.19,20 However, while it is known that social determinants21 and \\\\npsychological factors influence health outcomes,22 the extent to which these factors are \\\\nincluded in machine learning algorithms in the HHC setting is unknown.19,20\\\\nRecent literature has called for an increase in informatics, such as machine learning, in the \\\\nHHC setting to bring documentation-driven evidence to clinicians at the point of care.23‚Äì25 \\\\nDespite HHC being one of the fastest growing sectors of healthcare26 and the benefits of \\\\nmachine learning to predict patients at risk,27 no previous studies have summarized the state \\\\nof the science on machine learning applied to EHR data in the HHC setting. To address these \\\\nknowledge gaps, this study aims to critically appraise and synthesize information on the \\\\napplication of machine learning to predict a priori specified adverse outcomes using EHR \\\\ndata in the HHC setting. Our secondary aim was to summarize the different dimensions \\\\nof predictors (i.e., biological, psychological, and interpersonal) used to build the machine \\\\nlearning algorithms guided by the Biopsychosocial Model.\\\\nMaterials and methods\\\\nThis scoping review was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items \\\\nfor Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) \\\\nguidelines.28 The protocol describing this study was registered in Open Science Framework \\\\n(osf.io/g5zrj). Studies were eligible to be included if they addressed skilled health services \\\\nprovided in HHC, applied machine learning algorithms to predict adverse outcomes a priori, \\\\nused EHR data, focused on the adult population, and were published in English. Full \\\\ntext papers and conference proceedings covering quantitative machine learning algorithms \\\\nwere included. For this study, adverse events were defined as outcomes related to patient \\\\ndeterioration.29 Studies were excluded if they took place in a nursing home or skilled \\\\nnursing facility or focused on smart homes, sensors, or robots because they were outside \\\\nthe scope of this manuscript. Qualitative studies, dissertation papers, and research proposals \\\\nwere excluded.\\\\nHobensack et al.\\\\nPage 3\\\\nInt J Med Inform.

There was no restriction on the publication date. The full search strategy \\\\ncan be found in Appendix A. Our screening team included two registered nurses and two \\\\nadvanced practice nurses with informatics expertise (MH, JS, DS, MT). After duplicates \\\\nwere removed, all relevant studies were screened by two reviewers. Any conflicts were \\\\nresolved through discussion between the three reviewers until consensus was reached. This \\\\nprocess was repeated with full-text studies.\\\\nThe data extraction template was drafted by two co-authors (MH, MT). Other co-authors \\\\nwere invited to modify the template prior to charting the items. The extraction template \\\\nincluded information about the study and sample characteristics, algorithm overview, \\\\nmachine learning approaches, and algorithm performance. Upon consensus with the \\\\nappropriate variables to extract (e.g., purpose, data source, best-performing algorithm), two \\\\nreviewers (JS, DS) independently charted the data using the software, Covidence. A third \\\\nreviewer went through and resolved any disagreements (MH).\\\\nData were synthesized by mapping predictors to the Biopsychosocial Model.31‚Äì33 This \\\\nmodel assumes that to understand health holistically, a range of characteristics should be \\\\nconsidered, including an individual‚Äôs social, psychological, and behavioral dimensions.31,32 \\\\nLehman et al adapted this model to include the following dimensions: biological, \\\\npsychological, and interpersonal.33 The biological dimension encompasses medical histories \\\\ninfluencing the physical body; the psychological dimension encompasses coping and health \\\\nbehaviors; and the interpersonal dimension encompasses social support.33 Two reviewers \\\\nwere tasked with categorizing the predictors into one of the three dimensions of the \\\\nBiopsychosocial Model. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus meetings with the \\\\nscreening team (MH, JS, DS).\\\\nFour reviewers (MH, JS, DS, MT) performed a risk of bias analysis using the Prediction \\\\nModel Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST).34 One reviewer (MH) resolved \\\\ndisagreements after discussing the conflicts with another member of the screening team \\\\nwho has expertise in machine learning (MT). PROBAST facilitates risk of bias assessment \\\\nin four domains: participants, predictors, outcome, and analysis, and is specific to prediction \\\\nmodel studies. Per the PROBAST guidelines, if a study has at least one criterion indicating \\\\nan unclear or high risk of bias, the overall risk of bias for that study would be unclear or \\\\nhigh.\\\\nResults\\\\nOur initial search yielded 1,644 studies from four databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, \\\\nand Scopus). After duplicates were removed (n = 190), there were 1,454 studies eligible \\\\nfor title and abstract screening. A total of 1,378 studies were excluded, and 76 studies \\\\nwere moved to full-text review. Of those, 20 studies were included for synthesis. Among \\\\nthe excluded studies (n = 56), studies were most commonly excluded because they did not \\\\nHobensack et al.\\\\nPage 4\\\\nInt J Med Inform.

The \\\\nPRISMA flow diagram35 presented in Figure 1 summarizes the study selection process.\\\\nStudy characteristics\\\\nResults revealed the global advances in integrating machine learning into the HHC setting. \\\\nSix countries were represented in this review (30%). Ten studies (50%) did not include a \\\\nclear definition of HHC in their region. Most studies took place in the United States (n = 9; \\\\n45%)36‚Äì44 and Canada (n = 4; 20%)45‚Äì48 and used data retrospectively collected from 2015 \\\\nand earlier (n = 13; 65%)36‚Äì39,42‚Äì44,46,47,49‚Äì52 although some studies did not specify \\\\ndates (n = 3; 15%).40,48,53 The majority of studies were published between 2019 and 2022 (n \\\\n= 13; 65%).37,40‚Äì44,46,47,49,51,52,54,55\\\\nSample characteristics\\\\nMost studies did not focus on patients with a specific disease (n = 12; 60%). Among \\\\nstudies that did focus on a disease-specific population, patients with heart failure (n = 3; \\\\n15%)36,39,53 and advanced cancer (n = 2; 10%)50,55 were the most common. The number of \\\\nparticipants included in the studies ranged from 284 to 317,621. A summary of study and \\\\nsample characteristics is provided in Table 1.\\\\nAlgorithm overview\\\\nWhile all studies used data from the EHR, some studies included standardized assessments \\\\nstored in the EHR (n = 18; 90%).36‚Äì50,52,54,55 Standardized assessments, housed within the \\\\nEHR, include a set of standardized data elements allowing for easier comparison across \\\\ndifferent settings.56 For example, the United States‚Äô federally mandated Outcome and \\\\nAssessment Information Set (OASIS) assesses the patient‚Äôs functional status by collecting \\\\ndata about activities of daily living using a standardized set of questions such as describing \\\\nthe patient‚Äôs ability to ‚Äútransfer in and out of bed.‚Äù57 In the United States, EHR data \\\\n(e.g., demographics, clinical assessments) are typically collected by nurses within the \\\\nHHC agency,11 siloed from healthcare data collected in other care settings.23 The most \\\\ncited standardized assessment was the OASIS (n = 8; 40%)36‚Äì38,40‚Äì44 and Residential \\\\nAssessment Instrument - Home Care (RAI-HC) (n = 5; 25%).45‚Äì49 OASIS is a patient-\\\\nspecific assessment tool required by Medicare in the United States to guide a patient‚Äôs plan \\\\nof care, determine reimbursement, and collect quality measures in HHC.57 Similarly, the \\\\nRAI-HC is used in Canada to assess ‚Äúlong stay home care clients‚Äô health status, need for \\\\ncare, and basic background on housing and informal caregivers,‚Äù helping to guide care and \\\\ncollect quality indicators.58 In the included studies, only three studies included clinical notes \\\\nas a data source (15%).41,43,44\\\\nMost studies considered variables from all three domains of the Biopsychosocial Model (n = \\\\n12; 60%): biological (e.g., age, hematocrit, fall history), psychological (e.g., depression, \\\\nmemory deficit, coping), and interpersonal (e.g., lives alone, social support, informal \\\\ncaregiver status).38,40‚Äì42,44‚Äì50,52 Predictors that did not map to one of the three domains \\\\nwere categorized as ‚ÄúOther‚Äù which included variables such as the number of days in the \\\\nhospital, hospital utilization history, and the number of HHC visits. A list of variables \\\\nfrom each study mapped to the Biopsychosocial Model is provided in Appendix B. \\\\nHobensack et al.\\\\nPage 5\\\\nInt J Med Inform.

Although \\\\nsimilar reviews were conducted in the acute and ambulatory settings,64,65 this study was the \\\\nfirst to focus on the HHC setting, which represents one of the fastest-growing healthcare \\\\nsectors.26\\\\nMost studies (65%) included in this review were published between 2019 and 2022, \\\\nsuggesting a recent uptake of machine learning in the HHC setting.64,66 With that, 65% \\\\nof the studies used data collected from 2015 or earlier, indicating a delay between \\\\nretrospective data availability and analysis. This may be related to the lack of regulation \\\\nand standardization of EHR systems and data collected in the HHC setting globally, \\\\nwhich may increase the difficulty and time needed to extract, clean, and analyze the \\\\ndata.67,68 Generating global policies similar to the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care \\\\nTransformation (IMPACT) Act, which advances standardized data in post-acute care \\\\nsettings69 could lead to improved interoperability and analytical efficiency in the near future.\\\\nThis review paper highlights a gap in current research around the implementation of \\\\nmachine learning algorithms into the HHC clinical setting.30 A previous systematic review \\\\ndescribing prediction algorithms in post-acute care found that among the 37 models \\\\nreviewed, very few were ever implemented in practice.70 While clinical validation is \\\\nunderway in the acute care setting through randomized controlled trials,71‚Äì73 there is still \\\\na significant gap in the HHC setting. Shifting focus from an end goal of performance \\\\noptimization to practical clinical implementation is imperative to achieve the intention of \\\\nalmost all health-related machine learning algorithms ‚Äì to advance health and improve \\\\noutcomes. Seneviratne et al recommends that when building machine learning algorithms, \\\\ndevelopers should proactively consider clinical actionability, patient safety, and cost-utility \\\\nto optimize implementation in the clinical setting.74\\\\nAlthough this study examined the global scope of machine learning in HHC across six \\\\ncountries, it is important to highlight some regional differences. For example, in the United \\\\nStates, HHC is defined as a period of 30 to 60 days where skilled services such as nursing, \\\\nphysical, occupational, and speech therapy are provided to help patients transition back to \\\\nthe community.42,44 Alternatively, in Spain, the purpose of HHC is to provide interventions \\\\naimed at substituting inpatient hospitalization in a period of time that does not exceed \\\\nthe expected length of an inpatient hospitalization.52 Concerningly, half of the studies \\\\nincluded in this review did not provide detailed information on the structure of HHC in their \\\\ncountry. The differences in HHC structure and purpose also influence EHR documentation75 \\\\nwhich was not thoroughly discussed in all articles. Given the variation of HHC and EHRs \\\\nglobally,76‚Äì78 future studies should provide a detailed description of their regional HHC \\\\nstructure and EHR systems to help distinguish differences in patient populations, goals, \\\\ntimelines, and care structures. Providing further clarity around regional differences in the \\\\nHobensack et al.\\\\nPage 7\\\\nInt J Med Inform. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nstructure of HHC and EHR systems could lead to better tailoring and predictor selection \\\\nwhen developing machine learning algorithms globally.\\\\nStandardized assessments, such as OASIS and the RAI-HC, are commonly stored in the \\\\nEHR. Using standardized assessments can support interoperability, or the ability to exchange \\\\nhealth information, across systems or within a health system.79 In addition, the utilization \\\\nof standardized assessments has led to more evidence-based, consistent, and holistic \\\\nassessments among clinicians.80,81 In fact, all three domains of the Biopsychosocial Model \\\\nwere aligned with studies that used a standardized assessment tool as their data source, \\\\nsuggesting that standardized assessments lead to more comprehensive documentation. Thus, \\\\nincorporating standardized assessments into the EHR could improve comparability, access to \\\\ndata, interoperability, and generalizability in the HHC setting.\\\\nOur results reveal that most studies include predictors from all three domains of the \\\\nBiopsychosocial Model. Unsurprisingly, and similar to a previous study,82 biological \\\\ncharacteristics were included in all studies. Fewer studies included psychological (e.g., \\\\nmental health) and/or interpersonal (e.g., social determinants of health) predictors in their \\\\nmachine learning algorithms. Of the studies that did include these dimensions, they were \\\\noften from the structured standardized assessments. For psychological predictors, this may \\\\nbe related to using an assessment tool that does not comprehensively consider psychological \\\\ncharacteristics. For interpersonal predictors, this might be related to limited data capture \\\\nand documentation of social determinants of health in EHR systems.83 Previous studies \\\\nhave suggested that including social determinants of health can improve machine learning \\\\nprediction among individuals from racial or ethnic minorities.21,84,85 The inclusion of \\\\npsychological and interpersonal characteristics in machine learning algorithms could lead to \\\\nimproved equity in risk identification85 and proactive interventions for patients with mental \\\\nhealth conditions or social risk factors who are often stigmatized in healthcare.86,87\\\\nThe most frequently cited outcome of interest was hospitalization. In HHC, one of the \\\\nprimary goals is to prevent avoidable hospitalizations.88 Hospitalization rates reflect care \\\\nquality,4 with reducing readmission being financially incentivized;4 thus, we anticipate \\\\nthe number of machine learning algorithms focused on hospitalization to continue to be \\\\ncommon. Other outcomes specific to HHC, such as self-management, should be explored in \\\\nfuture studies to investigate other ways to reduce the risk of specific adverse outcomes prior \\\\nto hospitalization.89 In terms of disease conditions, a majority of the studies in this review \\\\ndid not focus on patients with a specific disease but rather on the general HHC population. \\\\nThe few studies that specified a condition focused on patients with heart failure or cancer. \\\\nFuture studies might examine specific disease-related predictors to identify characteristics \\\\nthat put specific populations at risk and inform the development of tailored interventions to \\\\nimprove patient outcomes.\\\\nThe wide range of sample sizes in the included studies demonstrates the versatility \\\\nof machine learning algorithms in studies with various sample sizes.90 Although small \\\\nsamples can be problematic for specific algorithms, such as Neural networks, other \\\\nalgorithms, such as Na√Øve bayes, can better accommodate smaller samples since it assumes \\\\nclass independence.91 However, data-demanding algorithms like Neural networks may \\\\nHobensack et al.\\\\nPage 8\\\\nInt J Med Inform. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nbe more prone to overfitting with smaller samples, leading to overestimated algorithm \\\\nperformance.92 Thus, we encourage researchers to consider sample size when determining \\\\nthe appropriate algorithm to apply to the data.\\\\nTree based algorithms (e.g., Decision tree, ADABoost, Classification and regression trees, \\\\nRandom forest) were frequently cited in this review and are known to be a reliable method \\\\nin biomedical literature.93 An advantage of a Decision tree is its interpretability,94 meaning \\\\nthat humans can understand the informative features driving the algorithm‚Äôs performance.95 \\\\nAlternatively, ‚Äúblack box‚Äù algorithms, such as Neural networks, are less interpretable, which \\\\nmay indicate why they were used less frequently94 in studies included in this review. \\\\nHowever, there has been a rise in the use of Neural networks96,97 applied to EHR data, given \\\\nits increased performance and reduction in preprocessing and feature engineering compared \\\\nto other explainable algorithms.97 Recent literature has published model-agnostic methods \\\\nto increase the interpretability of ‚Äúblack box‚Äù models, such as Shapley Values, which help \\\\nto explain features that are more informative (i.e., feature importance).95 Therefore, future \\\\nstudies may be more apt to apply Neural networks in the HHC setting. However, the studies \\\\nin this review that applied Neural networks did not outperform alternative algorithms, \\\\nsuggesting that other models should not be abandoned altogether.\\\\nAdditionally, NLP, an algorithm used to process unstructured text in clinical notes, was \\\\ninfrequently applied in studies included in this review. NLP is a method that takes \\\\ntext contained in clinical notes and makes it accessible to machine learning algorithms \\\\nby transforming the text into a structured form.98 Eighty percent of healthcare data is \\\\nunstructured data (e.g., clinical notes).99 Previous studies have demonstrated the value \\\\nof analyzing clinical notes to reflect clinician concerns to improve risk prediction in \\\\nHHC.44,100‚Äì102 More specifically, studies have found that additional information about \\\\npatients‚Äô social determinants103 and mental health104 can be found in clinical notes. Thus, \\\\nfuture studies in HHC might explore using NLP to extract additional information about \\\\na patient‚Äôs biological, psychological, and interpersonal characteristics to improve risk \\\\npredictive performance.\\\\nOverall, there were variations in algorithm performance among the included studies; \\\\nhowever, comparing algorithms with different performance metrics is challenging. Each \\\\nperformance metric has its advantages and disadvantages. F-score, which handles \\\\nimbalanced data, gives more weight to the majority class regardless of if it is the outcome \\\\nof interest.105 AUC is better for ranking overall prediction because it equally weights \\\\nboth classes.105 The variety of measures used to report algorithm performance suggests \\\\nno general consensus on a particular measure of best use.106 Therefore, it is important \\\\nthat the selection of performance metrics is thoughtfully considered and explained in the \\\\nmanuscript.107\\\\nLimitations\\\\nA few limitations of this scoping review need to be addressed. First, we recognize that \\\\nsub-optimal machine learning performance may be driven by the dataset‚Äôs quality and \\\\ninfluence the results. Additionally, the development of machine learning in recent years may \\\\nHobensack et al.\\\\nPage 9\\\\nInt J Med Inform. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nhave contributed to improved machine learning performance. The scope of this study did \\\\nnot include an in-depth analysis of how the data was collected, but future studies should \\\\nconsider the bias contained in these data. Similarly, no studies rigorously evaluated bias \\\\n(e.g., racial, age) in algorithm performance recognizing an important gap to consider in \\\\nfuture research. This review did not find HHC studies that compared prediction of machine \\\\nlearning models with clinical expert judgment and we recommend exploring this comparison \\\\nin the future studies. This scoping review contains multiple studies published by the same \\\\nresearch team, which suggests that minimal teams have published in this area within the \\\\nlast few years, potentially skewing the results. We mapped predictors to the Biopsychosocial \\\\nModel to get a comprehensive overview of predictors considered in the included machine \\\\nlearning models; however, an alternative framework may have led to a more granular \\\\ncategorization of predictors.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nWith the increased demand for healthcare provided in the home, we anticipate the number \\\\nof machine learning algorithms in HHC to continue to increase. Results from this review \\\\ndemonstrate the feasibility and potential of machine learning to support clinical care in the \\\\nHHC setting. Future studies should consider how these machine learning algorithms can \\\\nbe packaged into decision support systems that can guide clinical decision-making at the \\\\npoint of care to reduce adverse events, such as hospitalizations. In addition, incorporating \\\\npsychological and interpersonal characteristics into machine learning models will support \\\\ncomprehensive, holistic risk prediction. To enable widespread adoption of machine \\\\nlearning, stakeholders should consider how they can further promote the standardization \\\\nof documentation elements in the HHC setting.\\\\nSupplementary Material\\\\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\\\\nAcknowledgements\\\\nThis work was supported by the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) [grant T32NR007969 (MH, DS), \\\\nR01 NR018831]; the Jonas Scholarship (MH), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [grant R01 \\\\nHS027742].\\\\nReferences\\\\n1.

In medicine, excitement about \\\\nhuman-level performance (1) of ML for health is balanced against ethical concerns, such \\\\nas the potential for these tools to exacerbate existing health disparities (2‚Äì5).

Even more worrisome, healthcare models designed \\\\nto optimize referrals to long-term care management programs for millions of patients have \\\\nbeen found to exclude Black patients with similar health conditions compared to white \\\\npatients from care management programs (8).\\\\nMachine learning (ML):\\\\nthe study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience\\\\nML model:\\\\nan algorithm that has been trained on data for a specific use case\\\\nAlgorithm:\\\\na finite sequence of well-defined instructions used to solve a class of problems\\\\nA growing body of literature wrestles with the social implications of ML and technology. \\\\nSome of this work, termed critical data studies, is from a social science perspective (9, \\\\n10), whereas other work leads with a technical and computer science perspective (11‚Äì13). \\\\nWhile there is scholarship addressing social implications and algorithmic fairness in general, \\\\nthere has been less work at the intersection of health, ML, and fairness (14‚Äì16), despite the \\\\npotential life-or-death impacts of ML models (8, 17).\\\\nAlgorithmic fairness:\\\\nthe study of definitions and methods related to the justice of models\\\\nWhile researchers looking to develop ethical ML models for health can begin by drawing \\\\non bioethics principles (18, 19), these principles are designed to inform research and \\\\nclinical care practices. How these principles could inform the ML model development \\\\nethical pipeline remains understudied. We note that there has been significant work on other \\\\nimportant ethical issues that relate to ML and health, including reviews of consent and \\\\nprivacy (20), which we do not address here. Instead, we focus on equity in ML models that \\\\noperate on health data. We focus primarily on differences between groups induced by, or \\\\nrelated to, the model development pipeline, drawing on both the bioethics principle of justice \\\\nand the established social justice centering of public health ethics (21). Unjust differences in \\\\nquality and outcomes of healthcare between groups often reflect existing societal disparities \\\\nfor disadvantaged groups. We consider other bioethics principles such as beneficence and \\\\nnonmaleficence, but focus them primarily on groups of patients rather than on individuals.\\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 2\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

Here, we motivate the ethical considerations in the pipeline with a case \\\\nstudy of Black mothers in the United States, who die in childbirth at a rate three times \\\\nhigher than white women (22). This inequity is unjust because it connects to a history of \\\\nreproductive injustices faced by Black women in the United States, from gynecological \\\\nexperimentation on enslaved women to forced sterilizations (23, 24).\\\\n1.\\\\nProblem selection: This disparity occurs in part during problem selection \\\\nbecause maternal mortality is an understudied problem (25).\\\\n2.\\\\nData collection: Even after accounting for problem selection, data collection \\\\nfrom hospitals may differ in quality and quantity.

General \\\\nmodel outcome definitions for maternal health complications might overlook \\\\nconditions specific to Black mothers, e.g., fibroids (28).\\\\n4.\\\\nAlgorithm development: During algorithm development, models may not be able \\\\nto account for the confounding presence of societal bias.

Because \\\\nBlack women have a heightened risk of pregnancy-related death across income \\\\nand education levels (30), a biased prediction model could potentially automate \\\\npolicies or risk scores that disadvantage Black mothers.\\\\nModel outcome:\\\\nthe output of interest for predictive models\\\\nConfounding:\\\\nthe condition in which a feature influences both the dependent variable and independent \\\\nvariable, causing a spurious association\\\\nRisk score:\\\\na calculated number denoting the likelihood of adverse event\\\\nWe organize the rest of this review sequentially expanding on each of the five steps in the \\\\npipeline described above and in Figure 1. First, we look at problem selection, and explain \\\\nhow funding for ML for health research can lead to injustice. We then examine how data \\\\ncollection processes in funded research can amplify inequity and unfairness. We follow this \\\\nby exploring outcome definition and algorithm building, listing the multitude of factors that \\\\ncan impact model performance and explaining how these differences in performance relate \\\\nto issues of justice. We close with audits that should be considered for more robust and just \\\\ndeployments of models in health, as well as recommendations to practitioners for ethical, \\\\nfair, and just ML deployments.\\\\n2. PROBLEM SELECTION\\\\nThere are many factors that influence the selection of a research problem, from interest \\\\nto available funding. However, problem selection can also be a matter of justice if the \\\\nresearch questions that are proposed, and ultimately funded, focus on the health needs of \\\\nadvantaged groups. Below we provide examples of how disparities in research teams and \\\\nfunding priorities exacerbate existing socioeconomic, racial, and gender injustices.\\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 4\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

Global Health Injustice\\\\nThe so-called 10/90 gap refers to the fact that the vast majority of health research dollars \\\\nare spent on problems that affect a small fraction of the global population (31, 32). Diseases \\\\nthat are most common in lower-income countries receive far less funding than diseases \\\\nthat are most common in high-income countries (33) (relative to the number of individuals \\\\nthey affect). As an example, 26 poverty-related diseases account for 14% of the global \\\\ndisease burden, but receive only 1.3% of global health-related research and development \\\\nexpenditure. Nearly 60% of the burden of poverty-related neglected diseases occurs in \\\\nwestern and eastern sub-Saharan Africa, as well as South Asia. Malaria, tuberculosis, and \\\\nHIV/AIDS all have shares of global health-related research and development expenditure \\\\nthat are at least five times smaller than their share of global disease burden (33). This \\\\ndifference in rates of funding represents an injustice because it further exacerbates the \\\\ndisadvantages faced by populations in the Global South. While efforts like the ‚ÄúAll Of \\\\nUs‚Äù Research Program (34) and 23andMe‚Äôs call for collaboration (35) seek to collect more \\\\ninclusive data, these efforts have come under criticism for not reflecting global health \\\\nconcerns, particularly among Indigenous groups (36).\\\\nGlobal South:\\\\ncountries on one side of the North‚ÄìSouth divide, the other side being the countries of the \\\\nGlobal North\\\\n2.2. Racial Injustice\\\\nRacial bias affects which health problems are prioritized and funded. For example, sickle \\\\ncell disease and cystic fibrosis are both genetic disorders of similar severity, but sickle cell \\\\ndisease is more common in Black patients, while cystic fibrosis is more common in white \\\\npatients. In the United States, however, cystic fibrosis receives 3.4 times more funding per \\\\naffected individual from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the largest funder of \\\\nUS clinical research, and hundreds of times more private funding (37). The disparities in \\\\nfunding persist despite the 1972 Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act, which recognizes that \\\\nsickle cell has been neglected by the wider research community. Further, screening for sickle \\\\ncell disease is viewed by some as unfair targeting (38), and Black patients with the disease \\\\nwho seek treatment are often maligned as drug abusers (39).\\\\n2.3. Gender Injustice\\\\nWomen‚Äôs health conditions like endometriosis are poorly understood; as a consequence, \\\\neven basic statistics like the prevalence of endometriosis remain unknown, with estimates \\\\nranging from 1% to 10% of the population (40, 41). Similarly, the menstrual cycle is \\\\nstigmatized and understudied (40, 42), producing a dearth of understanding that undermines \\\\nthe health of half the global population. Basic facts about the menstrual cycle‚Äîincluding \\\\nwhich menstrual experiences are normal and which are predictive of pathology‚Äîremain \\\\nunknown (40). This lack of focus on the menstrual cycle propagates into clinical practice \\\\nand data collection despite evidence that it affects many aspects of health and disease (43, \\\\n44). Menstrual cycles are also not often recorded in clinical records and global health \\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 5\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\ndata (40). In fact, until 2019 the NIH did not have an R01 grant, the NIH‚Äôs original and \\\\nhistorically oldest grant mechanism, relating to the influence of sex and gender on health \\\\nand disease (45). Notably, recent work has moved to target such understudied problems \\\\nvia ambulatory women‚Äôs health-tracking mobile apps. These crowd-sourcing efforts stand \\\\nto accelerate women‚Äôs health research by collecting data from cohorts that are orders of \\\\nmagnitude larger than those used in previous studies (40).\\\\n2.4. Diversity of the Scientific Workforce\\\\nThe diversity of the scientific workforce profoundly influences the problems studied \\\\nand contributes to biases in problem selection (46). Research shows that scientists from \\\\nunderrepresented racial and gender groups tend to prioritize different research topics. They \\\\nproduce more novel research, but their innovations are taken up at lower rates (47). Female \\\\nscientists tend to study different scientific subfields, even within the same larger field [for \\\\nexample, within sociology, they have been historically better represented on papers about \\\\nsociology of the family or early childhood (48)], and express different opinions about ethical \\\\ndilemmas in computer science (49). Proposals from white researchers in the United States \\\\nare more likely to be funded by the NIH than proposals from Black researchers (50, 51), \\\\nwhich in turns affects what topics are given preference. For example, a higher fraction of \\\\nNIH proposals from Black scientists study community and population-level health (50). \\\\nOverall, this evidence suggests that diversifying the scientific workforce will lead to problem \\\\nselection that more equitably represents the interests and needs of the population as a whole.\\\\n3. DATA COLLECTION\\\\nThe role of health data is ever-expanding, with new data sources routinely being integrated \\\\ninto decision-making around health policy and design. This wealth of high-quality data, \\\\ncoupled with advancements in ML models, has played a significant role in accelerating \\\\nthe use of computationally informed policy and practice to strengthen healthcare and \\\\ndelivery platforms. Unfortunately, data can be biased in ways that have (or can lead to) \\\\ndisproportionate negative impacts on already marginalized groups. First, data on group \\\\nmembership can be completely absent. For instance, countries such as Canada and France \\\\ndo not record race and ethnicity in their nationalized health databases (52, 53), making \\\\nit impossible to study race-based disparities and hypotheses around associations of social \\\\ndeterminants of health. Second, data can be imbalanced. Recent work on acute kidney injury \\\\nachieved state-of-the-art prediction performance in a large dataset of 703,782 adult patients \\\\nusing 620,000 features; however, the authors noted that model performance was lower in \\\\nfemale patients since they make up 6.38% of patients in the training data (54). Other work \\\\nhas indicated that this issue cannot be simply addressed by pretraining a model in a more \\\\nbalanced data setting prior to fine-tuning on an imbalanced dataset (55). This indicates that a \\\\nmodel cannot be initialized with a balanced baseline representation that ameliorates issues of \\\\nimbalance in downstream tasks, and it suggests that we must solve this problem at the root, \\\\nbe it with more balanced comprehensive data, specialty learning algorithms, or combinations \\\\nthereof. Finally, while some sampling biases can be recognized and possibly corrected, \\\\nothers may be difficult to correct. For example, work in medical imaging has demonstrated \\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 6\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nthat models may overlook unforeseen stratification of conditions, like rare manifestations of \\\\ndiseases, which can result in harm in clinical settings (16, 56).\\\\nTraining data:\\\\ninformation that a ML model fits to and learns patterns from\\\\nIn this section, we discuss common biases in data collection. We consider two types of \\\\nprocesses that result in a loss of data. First, we examine processes that affect what kind \\\\nof information is collected (heterogenous data loss) across varying input types. Examples \\\\ninclude clinical trials with aggressive inclusion criteria or social media data that reflect \\\\nthose with access to devices hosting social media apps. Second, we examine processes that \\\\naffect whether an individual‚Äôs information is collected due to the individual‚Äôs population \\\\ntype (population-specific data losses), often across data input categories. For example, \\\\nundocumented immigrants may fear deportation if they participate in healthcare systems.\\\\nPopulation-specific data loss:\\\\nthe process whereby data can be lost in collection due to the features of the population\\\\n3.1. Heterogeneous Data Losses\\\\nSome data loss is specific to the data type, due to assumptions about noise that may have \\\\nbeen present during the collection process. However, data noise and missingness can cause \\\\nunjust inequities that impact populations in different ways. We cover four main data types: \\\\nrandomized controlled trials (RCTs), electronic health records (EHRs), administrative health \\\\ndata, and social media data.\\\\nHeterogeneous data loss:\\\\nthe process whereby data can be lost in collection due to the data type\\\\nData noise:\\\\nmeaningless information added to data that obscures the underlying information of the \\\\ndata\\\\nMissingness:\\\\nthe manner in which data are absent from a sample of the population\\\\n3.1.1. Randomized controlled trials.‚ÄîRCTs are often run specifically to gather \\\\nunbiased evidence of treatment effects. However, RCTs have notoriously aggressive \\\\nexclusion (or inclusion) criteria (57), which create study cohorts that are not representative \\\\nof general patient populations (58). In one study of RCTs used to define asthma treatment, \\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 7\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nan estimated 94% of the adult asthmatic population would not have been eligible for the \\\\ntrials (59). There is a growing methodological literature designing methods to generalize \\\\nRCT treatment effects to other populations (60). However, current empirical evidence \\\\nindicates that such generalizations can be challenging given available data or may require \\\\nstrong assumptions in practice.\\\\nRandomized controlled trial (RCT):\\\\na study in which subjects are allocated by chance to receive one of several interventions\\\\n3.1.2. Electronic health records.‚ÄîMuch recent work in ML also leverages large EHR \\\\ndata. EHR data are a complex reflection of patient health, healthcare systems, and providers, \\\\nwhere data missingness is a known, and meaningful, problem (61). As one salient example, \\\\na large study of laboratory tests to model three-year survival found that healthcare process \\\\nfeatures had a stronger predictive value than the patient‚Äôs physiological feaures (62). Further, \\\\nnot all treatments investigated in RCTs can be easily approximated in EHRs (63).\\\\nElectronic health record (EHR):\\\\ndigital version of a patient‚Äôs clinical history that is maintained by the provider over time\\\\nBiases in EHR data may arise due to differences in patient populations, access to care, \\\\nor the availability of EHR systems (64). As an example, the widely used MIMIC-III \\\\nEHR dataset includes most patients who receive care at the intensive care units in Beth \\\\nIsrael Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), but this sample is obviously limited by which \\\\nindividuals have access to care at BIDMC, which has a largely white patient population \\\\n(14). In the United States, uninsured Black and Hispanic or Latin(o/x) patients, as well as \\\\nHispanic or Latin(o/x) Medicaid patients, are less likely to have primary care providers with \\\\nEHR systems, as compared to white patients with private insurance (65). Other work has \\\\nshown that gender discrimination in healthcare access has not been systematically studied in \\\\nIndia, primarily due to a lack of reliable data (66).\\\\n3.1.3. Administrative health records.‚ÄîIn addition to RCTs and EHRs, healthcare \\\\nbilling claims data, clinical registries, and linked health survey data are also common \\\\ndata sources in population health and health policy research (67, 68), with known biases \\\\nconcerning which populations are followed and who is able to participate. Translating \\\\nsuch research into practice is a crucial part of maintaining healthcare quality, and limited \\\\nparticipation of minority populations by sexual orientation and gender identity (69), race and \\\\nethnicity (70), and language (71) can lead to health interventions and policies that are not \\\\ninclusive and can create new injustices for these already marginalized groups.\\\\nIntervention:\\\\na treatment, procedure, or other action taken to prevent or treat disease or improve health \\\\nin other ways\\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 8\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

Social media data.‚ÄîData from social media platforms and search-based \\\\nresearch naturally consist of only individuals with internet access (72). Even small \\\\nchoices like limiting samples to those from desktop versus mobile platforms constitute \\\\na problematic distinction in non‚ÄìNorth American contexts (73). Beyond concerns about \\\\naccess to resources or geographic limitations, data collection and scraping pipelines for most \\\\nsocial media cohorts do not yield a random sample of individuals. Further, the common \\\\npractice of limiting analysis to those satisfying a specified threshold of occurrence can lead \\\\nto skewed data. As an example, when processing the large volume of Twitter data (7.6 \\\\nbillion tweets), researchers may first restrict to users who can be mapped to a US county \\\\n(1.78 billion), then to those Tweets that contain only English (1.64 billion tweets), and \\\\nfinally to users who made more than 30 posts (1.53 billion) (74).\\\\n3.2. Population-Specific Data Losses\\\\nAs with data types, the modern data deluge does not apply equally to all communities. \\\\nHistorically underserved groups are often underrepresented, misrepresented, or entirely \\\\nmissing from health data that inform consequential health policy decisions. When \\\\nindividuals from disadvantaged communities appear in observational datasets, they are \\\\nless likely to be accurately captured due to errors in data collection and systemic \\\\ndiscrimination. Larger genomics datasets often target European populations, producing \\\\ngenetic risk scores that are more accurate in individuals of European ancestry than other \\\\nancestries (75). We note four specific examples of populations that are commonly impacted: \\\\nlow- and middle-income nationals, transgender and gender nonconforming individuals, \\\\nundocumented migrants, and pregnant women.\\\\n3.2.1. Low- and middle-income nationals.‚ÄîHealth data are infrequently collected \\\\ndue to resource constraints, and even basic disease statistic data such as prevalence of \\\\nmortality rates can be challenging to find for low- and middle-income nations (73). When \\\\ndata are collected, they are not digitized and often contain errors. In 2001, the World Health \\\\nOrganization found that only 9 out of the 46 member states in sub-Saharan Africa could \\\\nproduce death statistics for a global assessment of the burden of disease, with data coverage \\\\noften less than 60% in these countries (76).\\\\n3.2.2. Transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals.‚ÄîThe healthcare \\\\nneeds and experiences of transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals are not well \\\\ndocumented in datasets (77) because documented sex, not gender identity, is what is \\\\nusually available. However, documented sex is often discordant with gender identity \\\\nfor transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals. Apart from health documentation \\\\nconcerns, transgender people are often concerned about their basic physical safety when \\\\nreporting their identities. In the United States, it was only in 2016, with the release of the US \\\\nTransgender Survey, that there was a meaningfully sized dataset‚Äî28,000 respondents‚Äîto \\\\nenable significant analysis and quantification of discrimination and violence that transgender \\\\npeople face (77).\\\\n3.2.3. Undocumented immigrants.‚ÄîSafety concerns are important in data collection \\\\nfor undocumented migrants, where sociopolitical environments can lead to individuals \\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 9\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

When immigration policies limit access to \\\\npublic services for immigrants and their families, these restrictions lead to spillover effects \\\\non clinical diagnoses. As one salient example, autism diagnoses for Hispanic children in \\\\nCalifornia fell following aggressive federal anti-immigrant policies requiring citizenship \\\\nverification at hospitals (78).\\\\n3.2.4. Pregnant women.‚ÄîDespite pregnancy being neither rare nor an illness, the \\\\nUnited States continues to experience rising maternal mortality and morbidity rates. In the \\\\nUnited States, the maternal mortality rate has more than doubled from 9.8 per 100,000 \\\\nlive births in 2000 to 21.5 in 2014 (79). Importantly, disclosure protocols recommend \\\\nsuppression of information in nationally available datasets when the number of cases or \\\\nevents in a data cell is low, in order to reduce the likelihood of a breach of confidentiality. \\\\nFor example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suppresses numbers for \\\\ncounties with fewer than 10 deaths for a given disease (80). Although these data omissions \\\\noccur because of patient privacy, such censoring on the dependent variable introduces \\\\nparticularly pernicious statistical bias, and as a result, much remains to be understood about \\\\nwhat community, health facility, patient, and provider-level factors drive high mortality rates.\\\\nCensoring:\\\\nthe mechanism through which data values are removed from observation\\\\n4. OUTCOME DEFINITION\\\\nThe next step in the model pipeline is to define the outcome of interest for a healthcare \\\\ntask. Even seemingly straightforward tasks like defining whether a patient has a disease \\\\ncan be skewed by how prevalent diseases are or how they manifest in some patient \\\\npopulations. For example, a model predicting if a patient will develop heart failure will \\\\nneed labeled examples both of patients who have heart failure and of patients without heart \\\\nfailure. Choosing these patients can rely on parts of the EHR that may be skewed due \\\\nto lack of access to care or due to abnormalities in clinical care: For example, economic \\\\nincentives may alter diagnosis code logging (81), clinical protocol affects the frequency \\\\nand observation of abnormal tests (62), historical racial mistrust may delay care and affect \\\\npatient outcomes (82), and naive data collection can yield inconsistent labels in chest X-rays \\\\n(56). Such biased labels, and the resulting models, may cause clinical practitioners to \\\\nallocate resources poorly.\\\\nDiagnosis code:\\\\na label in patient records of disease occurrence, which may be subject to \\\\nmisclassification, used primarily for billing purposes\\\\nWe discuss social justice considerations in two examples of commonly modeled healthcare \\\\noutcomes: clinical diagnosis and healthcare costs.

Clinical Diagnosis\\\\nClinical diagnosis is a fundamental task for clinical prediction models, e.g., models for \\\\ncomputer-aided diagnosis from medical imaging. In clinical settings, researchers often select \\\\npatient disease occurrence as the prediction label for models. However, there are many \\\\noptions for the choice of a disease occurrence label. For example, the outcome label for \\\\ndeveloping cardiovascular disease could be defined through the occurrence of specific \\\\nphrases in clinical notes. However, women can manifest symptoms of acute coronary \\\\nsyndrome differently (83) and receive delayed care as a result (84), which may then manifest \\\\nin diagnosis labels derived from the clinical notes being gender skewed. Because differences \\\\nin label noise result in disparities in model impact, researchers have the responsibility \\\\nto choose and improve disease labels so that these inequalities do not further exacerbate \\\\ndisparities in health.\\\\nLabel noise:\\\\nerrors or otherwise obscuring information that affects the quality of the labels\\\\nAdditionally, it is important to consider the healthcare system in which disease labels are \\\\nlogged. For example, healthcare providers leverage diagnosis codes for billing purposes, not \\\\nclinical research. As a result, diagnosis codes can create ambiguities because of overlap and \\\\nhierarchy in codes. Moreover, facilities have incentives to underreport (81) and overreport \\\\n(85, 86) outcomes, yielding differences in model representations.\\\\nRecent advances in improving disease labels target statistical corrections based on estimates \\\\nof the label noise. For instance, a positive label may be reliable, but the omission of a \\\\npositive label could indicate either a negative label (i.e., no disease) or merely a missed \\\\npositive label. Methods to address the positive-unlabeled setting use estimated noise rates \\\\n(87) or hand-curated labels from clinicians that are strongly correlated with positive labels, \\\\nknown also as silver-standard labels (88). Clinical analysis of sources of error in disease \\\\nlabels can also guide improvements (89) and identify affected groups (56).\\\\n4.2. Healthcare Costs\\\\nDevelopers of clinical models may choose to predict healthcare costs, meaning the ML \\\\nmodel seeks to predict which patients will cost the healthcare provider more in the future. \\\\nSome model developers may use healthcare costs as a proxy for future health needs to \\\\nguide accurate targeting of interventions (8), with the underlying assumption that addressing \\\\npatients with future health needs will limit future costs. Others may explicitly want to \\\\nunderstand patients who will have high healthcare costs to reduce the total cost of healthcare \\\\n(90). However, because socioeconomic factors affect both access to healthcare and access to \\\\nfinancial resources, these models may yield predictions that exacerbate inequities.\\\\nFor model developers seeking to optimize for health needs, healthcare costs can deviate \\\\nfrom health needs on an individual level because of patient socioeconomic factors. For \\\\ninstance, in a model used to allocate care management program slots to high-risk patients, \\\\nthe choice of future healthcare costs as a predictive outcome led to racial disparities in \\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 11\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\npatient allocation to the program (8). Healthcare costs can differ from health needs on an \\\\ninstitutional level due to under-insurance and undertreatment within the patient population \\\\n(91). After defining health disparities as all differences except those due to clinical need \\\\nand preferences, researchers have found racial disparities in mental healthcare. Specifically, \\\\nwhite patients had higher rates of initiation of treatment for mental health compared to \\\\nBlack and Hispanic or Latin(o/x) patients. Because the analysis controls for health needs, the \\\\ndisparities are solely a result of differences in healthcare access and systemic discrimination \\\\n(92).\\\\nAddressing issues that arise from the use of healthcare costs depends on the setting of the \\\\nML model. In cases where health need is of highest importance, a natural solution is to \\\\nchoose another outcome definition besides healthcare costs, e.g., the number of chronic \\\\ndiseases as a measure of health needs. If a model developer is most concerned with cost, it \\\\nis possible to correct for health disparities in predicting healthcare costs by building fairness \\\\nconsiderations directly into the predictive model objective function (93). Building these \\\\ntypes of algorithmic procedures is further discussed in Section 5.\\\\n5. ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT\\\\nAlgorithm development considers the construction of the underlying computation for the \\\\nML model and presents a major vulnerability and opportunity for ethical ML in healthcare. \\\\nJust as data are not neutral, algorithms are also not neutral. A disproportionate amount of \\\\npower lies with research teams that, after determining the research questions, make decisions \\\\nabout critical components of an algorithm such as the loss function (46, 94). In the case \\\\nof loss functions, common choices like the L1 absolute-error loss and L2 squared-error \\\\nloss do not target the same conditional functions of the outcome but instead minimize the \\\\nerror in the median and mean, respectively. Using a surrogate loss (e.g., hinge loss for the \\\\nerror rate) can provide computational efficiency, but it may not reflect the ethical criteria \\\\nthat we truly care about. Recent work has shown that models trained with a surrogate loss \\\\nmay exhibit approximation errors that disproportionately affect undersampled groups in \\\\nthe training data (95). Similarly, one might choose to optimize the worst-case error across \\\\ngroups as opposed to the average overall error. Such choices may seem purely technical but \\\\nreflect value statements about what should be optimized, potentially leading to differences in \\\\nperformance among marginalized groups (96).\\\\nLoss function:\\\\nthe relation that determines the error between algorithm output and a given label, which \\\\nthe algorithm uses to optimize\\\\nIn this section, we review several crucial factors in model development that potentially \\\\nimpact ethical deployment capacity: understanding (and accounting for) confounding, \\\\nfeature selection, tuning parameters, and the definition of ‚Äúfairness‚Äù itself.\\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 12\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

Understanding Confounding\\\\nDeveloping models that use sensitive attributes without a clear causal understanding of \\\\ntheir relationship to outcomes of interest can significantly affect model performance and \\\\ninterpretation. This is relevant to algorithmic problems focused on prediction, not just causal \\\\ninference. Confounding features‚Äîi.e., those features that influence both the independent \\\\nvariables and the dependent variable‚Äîrequire careful attention. The vast majority of models \\\\nlearn patterns based on observed correlations between training data, even when such \\\\ncorrelations do not occur in test data. For instance, recent work has demonstrated that \\\\nclassification models designed to detect hair color learn gender-biased decision boundaries \\\\nwhen trained on confounded data, i.e., if women are primarily blond in training data, the \\\\nmodel incorrectly associates gender with the hair label in test samples (97).\\\\nSensitive attribute:\\\\na specified patient feature (e.g., race, gender) that is considered important for fairness \\\\nconsiderations\\\\nTest data:\\\\nunseen information that a model predicts on and is evaluated against\\\\nAs ML methods are increasingly used for clinical decision support, it is critical to account \\\\nfor confounding features. In one canonical example, asthmatic patients presenting with \\\\npneumonia are given aggressive interventions that ultimately improve their chances of \\\\nsurvival over nonasthmatic patients (98). When the hospital protocol assigned additional \\\\ntreatment to patients with asthma, those patients had improved outcomes. Thus the treatment \\\\npolicy was a confounding factor in a seemingly straightforward prediction task by altering \\\\nthe data such that patients with asthma were erroneously predicted by models to have lower \\\\nrisk of dying from pneumonia.\\\\nSimply controlling for confounding features by including them as features in classification \\\\nor regression models may be insufficient to train reliable models because features can have a \\\\nmediating or moderating effect (posttreatment effect on outcomes of interest) and have to be \\\\nincorporated differently into model design (99).\\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 13\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nModern ML and causal discovery techniques can identify sources of confounding at scale \\\\n(100), although validation of such methods can be challenging because of the lack of \\\\ncounterfactual data. ML methods have also been proposed to estimate causal effects from \\\\nobservational data (101, 102). In practice, when potential hidden confounding is suspected, \\\\neither mediating features or proxies can be leveraged (99, 103) or sensitivity analysis \\\\nmethods can be used to determine potential sources of errors in effect estimates (104). \\\\nData-augmentation and sampling methods may also be used to mitigate effects of model \\\\nconfounding. For example, augmenting X-ray images with rotated and translated variants \\\\ncan help train a model that is not sensitive to orientation of an image (105).\\\\n5.2. Feature Selection\\\\nWith large-scale digitization of EHRs and other sources, sensitive attributes like race \\\\nand ethnicity may be increasingly available (although prone to misclassification and \\\\nmissingness). However, blindly incorporating factors like race and gender in a predictive \\\\nmodel may exacerbate inequities for a wide range of diagnostics and treatments (106). These \\\\nresulting inequities can lead to unintended and permanent embedding of biases in algorithms \\\\nused for clinical care. For example, vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) scores are used to \\\\npredict success of trial of labor of pregnant women with a prior cesarean section; however, \\\\nthese scores explicitly include a race component as an input, which reduces the chance of \\\\nVBAC success for Black and Hispanic women. Although researchers found that previous \\\\nobservational studies showed correlation between racial identity and success of trial of labor \\\\n(107), the underlying cause of this association is not well understood. Such naive inclusion \\\\nof race information could exacerbate disparities in maternal mortality. This ambiguity calls \\\\ninto question race-based correction in scores like VBAC (106).\\\\nAutomation in feature selection does not eliminate the need for contextual understanding. \\\\nFor example, stepwise regression is commonly used and taught as a technique for feature \\\\nselection despite known limitations (108). While specific methods have varying initialization \\\\n(e.g., start with an empty set of features or a full set of features) and processing steps \\\\n(e.g., deletion versus addition of features), most rely on p-values, R2, or other global fit \\\\nmetrics to select features. Weaknesses of stepwise regressions include the misleading nature \\\\nof p-values and the fact that the final set depends on if and when features were considered \\\\n(109). In ML, penalized regressions like lasso regression are popular for automated feature \\\\nselection, but the lasso trades potential increases in estimation bias for reductions in \\\\nvariance by shrinking some feature coefficients to zero. Features selected by lasso may \\\\nbe colinear with other features not selected (110). Over-interpretation of the selected features \\\\nin any automated procedures should therefore be avoided in practice given these pitfalls. \\\\nResearchers should also consider the humans-in-the-loop framework, whereby incorporation \\\\nof automated procedures is blended with investigator knowledge (111).\\\\nStepwise regression:\\\\na method of estimation whereby each feature is sequentially considered by addition or \\\\nsubtraction to the existing feature set\\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 14\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

Tuning Parameters\\\\nThere are many tuning parameters that may be set a priori or selected via cross-validation \\\\n(110). These range from the learning rate in a neural network to the minimum size of \\\\nthe terminal leaves in a random forest. In the latter example, default settings in R for \\\\nclassification will allow trees to grow until there is just one observation in a terminal leaf. \\\\nThis can lead to overfitting the model to the training data and a loss of generalizability to \\\\nthe target population. Lack of generalizability is a central concern for ethical ML given the \\\\npreviously discussed issues in data collection and study inclusion. When data lack diversity \\\\nand are not representative of the target population where the model would be deployed, \\\\noverfitting algorithms to this data has the potential to disproportionately harm marginalized \\\\ngroups (112). Using cross-validation to select tuning parameters does not automatically \\\\nsolve these problems, as cross-validation still operates with respect to an a priori‚Äìchosen \\\\noptimization target.\\\\nGeneralizability:\\\\nthe ability of a model to apply in a setting different from the one in which it was trained\\\\n5.4. Performance Metrics\\\\nThere are many commonly used performance metrics for model evaluation, such as area \\\\nunder the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), area under the precision-recall \\\\ncurve (AUPRC), and calibration (113). However, the appropriate metrics to optimize depend \\\\non the intended use case and relative value of true positives, false positives, true negatives, \\\\nand false negatives. Not only can AUC be misleading when considering other global fit \\\\nmetrics (e.g., high AUC masking a weak true positive rate) but it also does not describe the \\\\nimpact of the model across selected groups. Furthermore, even so-called objective metrics \\\\nand scores can be deeply flawed and lead to over- or undertreatment of minorities if blindly \\\\napplied (114). Note that robust reporting of results should include an explicit statement of \\\\nother nonoptimized metrics, including the original intended use case, the training cohort and \\\\ncase, or the level of model uncertainty.\\\\nPerformance metric:\\\\nscore or other quantitative representation of a model‚Äôs quality and ability to achieve goals\\\\nAUC:\\\\na measure of the sensitivity and specificity of a model for each decision threshold\\\\nAUPRC:\\\\na measure of precision and recall of a model for each decision threshold\\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 15\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

Group Fairness Definition\\\\nThe specific definition of fairness for a given application often impacts the choice of a \\\\nloss function, and therefore the underlying algorithm. Individual fairness imposes classifier \\\\nperformance requirements that operate over pairs of individuals; e.g., similar individuals \\\\nshould be treated similarly (115). Group fairness operates over protected groups (based on \\\\nsome sensitive attribute) by requiring that a classifier performance metric be balanced across \\\\nthose groups (116, 117). For instance, a model may be partially assessed by calculating \\\\nthe true positive rate separately among rural and urban populations to ensure risk score \\\\nsimilarity. Regressions subject to group fairness constraints or penalties optimizing toward \\\\njoint global and group fit considerations have also been developed (93, 118, 119).\\\\nGroup fairness:\\\\na principle whereby predefined patient groups should receive similar model performance\\\\nRecent work has focused on identifying and mitigating violations of fairness definitions \\\\nin healthcare settings. While most of these algorithms have emerged outside the field of \\\\nhealthcare, researchers have designed penalized and constrained regressions to improve \\\\nthe performance of health insurance plan payment. This payment system impacts tens \\\\nof millions of lives in the United States and is known to undercompensate insurers \\\\nfor individuals with certain health conditions, including mental health and substance \\\\nuse disorders, in part because billing codes do not accurately capture diagnoses \\\\n(120). Undercompensation creates incentives for insurers exclude individuals with these \\\\nhealth conditions from enrollment, limiting their access to care. Regressions subject \\\\nto group fairness constraints or penalties have been successful in removing nearly all \\\\nundercompensation for a single group with negligible impacts on global fit (93). Subsequent \\\\nwork incorporating multiple groups into the loss function also saw improvements in \\\\nundercompensation for the majority of groups not included (121).\\\\n6. POSTDEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS\\\\nOften the goal of model training is to ultimately deploy it in a clinical, epidemiological, \\\\nor policy service. However, deployed models can have lasting ethical impact beyond the \\\\nmodel performance measured in development: For example, in the inclusion of race in the \\\\nclinical risk scores described above that may lead to chronic over- or undertreatment (106). \\\\nHere we outline considerations for robust deployment by highlighting the need for careful \\\\nperformance reporting and auditing generalizability, documentation, and regulation.\\\\n6.1. Quantifying Impact\\\\nUnlike in other settings with high-stakes decisions (e.g., aviation), clinical staff performance \\\\nis not audited by an external body (122). Instead, clinicians are often a self-governing body, \\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 16\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nrelying on clinicians themselves to determine when a colleague is underperforming or in \\\\nbreach of ethical practice principles, e.g., through such tools as surgical morbidity and \\\\nmortality conferences (123). Clinical staff can also struggle to keep abreast of what current \\\\nbest practice recommendations are, as these can change dramatically over time; one study \\\\nfound that more than 400 previously routine practices were later contradicted in leading \\\\nclinical journals (124).\\\\nHence, it is important to measure and address the downstream impact of models \\\\nthough audits for bias and examination of clinical impact (6). Regular model auditing \\\\npostdeployment, i.e., detailed inspection of model performance on various groups and \\\\noutcomes, may reveal the impact of models on different populations (8) and identify areas \\\\nof potential concern. Some recent work has targeted causal models in dynamic systems in \\\\norder to reduce the severity of bias (125). Others have targeted bias reduction through model \\\\nconstruction with explicit guarantees about balanced performance (16) or by specifying \\\\ngroups that must have equal performance (126). Additionally, there is the possibility that \\\\nmodels may help to debias current clinical care by reducing known biases against minorities \\\\n(127) and disadvantaged majorities (128).\\\\nModel auditing:\\\\nthe postdeployment inspection of model performance on groups and outcomes\\\\n6.2. Model Generalizability\\\\nAs has been raised in previous sections, a crucial concern with model deployment is \\\\ngeneralization. Any shifts in data distributions can significantly impact model performance \\\\nwhen the settings for development and for deployment differ. For example, chest X-ray \\\\ndiagnosis models can have high performance on test data drawn from the same hospital \\\\nbut degrade rapidly on data from another hospital (129). Other work in gender bias on \\\\nchest X-ray data has demonstrated both that small proportions of female chest X-rays \\\\ndegrade diagnostic performance accuracy in female patients (130) and that this is not simply \\\\naddressed in all cases by adding in more female X-rays (131). Even within a single hospital, \\\\nmodels trained on data from an initial EHR system data deteriorated significantly when \\\\ntested on data from a new EHR system (132). Finally, data artifacts that induce strong priors \\\\nin what patterns ML models are sensitive to have the potential to perpetrate harms when \\\\nused without awareness (133). For example, patients with dark skin can have morphological \\\\nvariation and disease manifestations that are not easily detected under the defaults that are \\\\nset by predominantly white-skinned patients (134).\\\\nData artifact:\\\\na flaw in data caused by equipment, techniques, or conditions that is unrelated to model \\\\noutput\\\\nSeveral algorithms have recently been proposed to account for distribution shifts in \\\\ndata (135, 136). However, these algorithms have significant limitations, as they typically \\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 17\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nrequire assumptions about the nature or amount of distributional shift an algorithm can \\\\naccommodate. Some, like that of Reference 136, may require a clear indication of which \\\\ndistributions in a healthcare pipeline are expected to change, and may develop models for \\\\nprediction accordingly. Many of these assumptions may be verifiable. If not, periodically \\\\nmonitoring for data shifts (137) and potentially retraining models when performance \\\\ndeteriorates due to such shifts are imperative deployment considerations with significant \\\\nethical implications.\\\\n6.3. Model and Data Documentation\\\\nClear documentation enables insight into the model development and data collection. Good \\\\nmodel documentation should include clinically specific features of model development that \\\\ncan be assessed and recorded beforehand, such as logistics within the clinical setting, \\\\npotential unintended consequences, and trade-offs between bias and performance (138). In \\\\naddition to raising ethical concerns in the pipeline, the process of co-designing checklists \\\\nwith clinical practitioners formalizes ad hoc procedures and empowers individual advocates \\\\n(139). Standardized reporting of model performance‚Äîsuch as the one-page summary model \\\\ncards for model reporting (140)‚Äîcan empower clinical practitioners to understand model \\\\nlimitations and future model developers to identify areas of improvement. Similarly, better \\\\ndocumentation of the data supporting initial model training can help expose sources of \\\\ndiscrimination in the collected data. Modelers could use datasheets for datasets to detail the \\\\nconditions of data collection (141).\\\\n6.4. Regulation\\\\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) bears responsibility for the \\\\nregulation of healthcare ML models. As there does not exist comprehensive guidance for \\\\nhealthcare model research and subsequent deployment, the opportunity is ripe to create \\\\na comprehensive framework to audit and regulate models. Currently, the FDA‚Äôs proposed \\\\nML-specific modifications to the software as a medical device regulations draw a distinction \\\\nbetween models that are trained and then frozen prior to clinical deployment and models that \\\\ncontinue to learn on observed outcomes. Although models in the latter class can leverage \\\\nlarger, updated datasets, they also face additional risk due to model drift and may need \\\\nadditional audits (142). Such frameworks should explicitly account for health disparities \\\\nacross the stages of ML development in health and ensure health equity audits as part of \\\\npostmarket evaluation (143). We also note that there are many potential legal implications, \\\\ne.g., in malpractice and liability suits, that will require new solutions (144).\\\\nResearchers have proposed additional frameworks to guide clinical model development, \\\\nwhich could inspire future regulation. ML model regulation could draw from existing \\\\nregulatory frameworks: An RCT for ML models would assess patient benefit compared \\\\nto a control cohort of standard clinical practice (145), and a drug development pipeline for \\\\nML models would define a protocol for adverse events and model recalls (146). The clinical \\\\ninterventions accompanying the clinical ML model should be analyzed to contextualize the \\\\nuse of the model in the clinical setting (147).\\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 18\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

RECOMMENDATIONS\\\\nIn this review, we have described the ethical considerations at each step of the ML model \\\\ndevelopment pipeline we introduced. While most researchers will address known challenges \\\\nsuch as deployed task accuracy and outcome distribution shift, they are unlikely to be aware \\\\nof the full magnitude of the hidden challenges such as existing health inequities or outcome \\\\nlabel bias. As seen in Figure 2, many hidden pipeline challenges can go unaddressed in a \\\\ntypical ML health project, but they have serious ethical repercussions. With these challenges \\\\nin mind, we propose five general recommendations that span the pipeline stages:\\\\n1.\\\\nProblems should be tackled by diverse teams and using frameworks that increase \\\\nthe probability that equity will be achieved. Further, historically understudied \\\\nproblems are important targets to practitioners looking to perform high-impact \\\\nwork.\\\\n2.\\\\nData collection should be framed as an important front-of-mind concern in \\\\nthe ML modeling pipeline, clear disclosures should be made about imbalanced \\\\ndatasets, and researchers should engage with domain experts to ensure that data \\\\nreflecting the needs of underserved and understudied populations are gathered.\\\\n3.\\\\nOutcome choice should reflect the task at hand and should preferably be \\\\nunbiased. If the outcome label has ethical bias, the source of inequity should be \\\\naccounted for in ML model design, leveraging literature that attempts to remove \\\\nethical biases during preprocessing, or with use of a reasonable proxy.\\\\n4.\\\\nReflection on the goals of the model is essential during development and should \\\\nbe articulated in a preanalysis plan. In addition to technical choices like loss \\\\nfunction, researchers must interrogate how, and whether, a model should be \\\\ndeveloped to best answer a research question, as well as what caveats are \\\\nincluded.\\\\n5.\\\\nAudits should be designed to identify specific harms and should be paired with \\\\nmethods and procedures. Harms should be examined group by group, rather \\\\nthan at a population level. ML ethical design checklists are one possible tool to \\\\nsystematically enumerate and consider such ethical concerns prior to declaring \\\\nsuccess in a project.\\\\nFinally, we note that ML also could and should be harnessed to create shifts in power \\\\nin health-care systems (148). This might mean actively selecting problems for the benefit \\\\nof underserved patients, designing methods to target systemic interventions for improved \\\\naccess to care and treatments, or enforcing evaluations with the explicit purpose of \\\\npreserving patient autonomy. In one salient example, the state of California reduced \\\\ndisparities in rates of obstetric hemorrhage (and therefore maternal mortality for women \\\\nof color) by weighing blood loss sponges, i.e., making access to treatment consistent and \\\\nunbiased for all women (149). Models could similarly be harnessed to learn and recommend \\\\nconsistent rules, potentially giving researchers an opportunity to debias current clinical \\\\ncare (150), measure racial disparities and mistrust in end-of-life care (82), and improve \\\\nknown biases against minorities (127) and disadvantaged majorities (128). Ultimately, \\\\nthe responsibility for ethical models and behavior lies with a broad community, but it \\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 19\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

If not, they could be uncurable and deadly. Due to this reason, there is a need of analysing complex medical data, medical reports, and medical images at a lesser time but with greater accuracy. There are even some instances where certain abnormalities cannot be directly recognized by humans. In healthcare for computational decision making, machine learning approaches are being used in these types of situations where a crucial data analysis needs to be performed on medical data to reveal hidden relationships or abnormalities which are not visible to humans. Implementing algorithms to perform such tasks itself is difficult, but what makes it even more challenging is to increase the accuracy of the algorithm while decreasing the required time for the algorithm to execute. In the early days, processing of large amount of medical data was an important task which resulted in machine learning being adapted in the biological domain. Since this happened, the biology and biomedical fields have been reaching higher levels by exploring more knowledge and identifying relationships which were never observed before. Reaching to its peak now the concern is being diverted towards treating patients not only based on the type of disease but also their genetics, which is known as precision medicine. Modifications in machine learning algorithms are being performed and tested daily to improve the performance of the algorithms in analysing and presenting more accurate information. In the healthcare field, starting from information extraction from medical documents until the prediction or diagnosis of a disease, machine learning has been involved. Medical imaging is a section that was greatly improved with the integration of machine learning algorithms to the field of computational biology. Nowadays, many disease diagnoses are being performed by medical image processing using machine learning algorithms.

If not, they\\\\ncould be uncurable and deadly. Due to this reason, there is a need of analysing complex medical data, medical reports, and medical\\\\nimages at a lesser time but with greater accuracy. Tere are even some instances where certain abnormalities cannot be directly\\\\nrecognized by humans. In healthcare for computational decision making, machine learning approaches are being used in these\\\\ntypes of situations where a crucial data analysis needs to be performed on medical data to reveal hidden relationships or ab-\\\\nnormalities which are not visible to humans. Implementing algorithms to perform such tasks itself is diÔ¨Écult, but what makes it\\\\neven more challenging is to increase the accuracy of the algorithm while decreasing the required time for the algorithm to execute.\\\\nIn the early days, processing of large amount of medical data was an important task which resulted in machine learning being\\\\nadapted in the biological domain. Since this happened, the biology and biomedical Ô¨Åelds have been reaching higher levels by\\\\nexploring more knowledge and identifying relationships which were never observed before. Reaching to its peak now the concern\\\\nis being diverted towards treating patients not only based on the type of disease but also their genetics, which is known as precision\\\\nmedicine. ModiÔ¨Åcations in machine learning algorithms are being performed and tested daily to improve the performance of the\\\\nalgorithms in analysing and presenting more accurate information. In the healthcare Ô¨Åeld, starting from information extraction\\\\nfrom medical documents until the prediction or diagnosis of a disease, machine learning has been involved. Medical imaging is a\\\\nsection that was greatly improved with the integration of machine learning algorithms to the Ô¨Åeld of computational biology.\\\\nNowadays, many disease diagnoses are being performed by medical image processing using machine learning algorithms. In\\\\naddition, patient care, resource allocation, and research on treatments for various diseases are also being performed using machine\\\\nlearning-based computational decision making. Troughout this paper, various machine learning algorithms and approaches that\\\\nare being used for decision making in the healthcare sector will be discussed along with the involvement of machine learning in\\\\nhealthcare applications in the current context. With the explored knowledge, it was evident that neural network-based deep\\\\nlearning methods have performed extremely well in the Ô¨Åeld of computational biology with the support of the high processing\\\\npower of modern sophisticated computers and are being extensively applied because of their high predicting accuracy and\\\\nreliability. When giving concern towards the big picture by combining the observations, it is noticeable that computational\\\\nbiology and biomedicine-based decision making in healthcare have now become dependent on machine learning algorithms, and\\\\nthus they cannot be separated from the Ô¨Åeld of artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence.\\\\n1. Introduction\\\\nArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence includes approaches and techniques\\\\nlike machine learning, machine reasoning, and robotics. In\\\\nthis review, the main concern will be given towards machine\\\\nlearning as it is the approach that is being applied using\\\\ndiÔ¨Äerent techniques and algorithms in various healthcare\\\\nactivities. Te use of machine learning to solve clinical\\\\nproblems is called revolutionary clinical decision making.\\\\nWhen machine learning is being used in clinical decision\\\\nHindawi\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\nVolume 2021, Article ID 6679512, 20 pages\\\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6679512\\\\nmaking, it implies that the system will perceive a given\\\\nindividual by collecting and interpreting data relevant for\\\\nthe health of that individual and it will reason on the data to\\\\nsuggest the best actions that need to be performed to\\\\nmaintain or improve the individual‚Äôs health. In machine\\\\nlearning, the system needs to learn the context of the\\\\nproblem and the quality of data provided. Normally, these\\\\nalgorithms are not very strong and concrete at the beginning,\\\\nbut by performing a single and repetitive task, the algorithm\\\\nbecomes\\\\nstrong\\\\nwith\\\\nincreased\\\\nnumber\\\\nof\\\\nprevious\\\\nexperiences.\\\\nTere are two distinct ways that a clinical decision-\\\\nmaking solution interprets by comparing previous knowl-\\\\nedge that is included in the dataset. One is the fast or in-\\\\ntuitive approach which uses underlying clinical pattern\\\\nrecognition and is typically used in medical emergencies. But\\\\nthese have a higher possibility of being erroneous and\\\\nprovide incomplete perception. Te other approach is the\\\\nslow or reasoned method. It is deductive, deliberate, and\\\\nneeds greater intellectual, time, and cost information. But\\\\nthe decisions made are more accurate. As all these decisions\\\\nare based on the data that are being collected, analysed, and\\\\nstored in complex and heterogeneous forms, it is important\\\\nto use algorithmic approaches to minimize the computing\\\\npower required. Machine learning applications have cur-\\\\nrently contributed massively to the healthcare sector\\\\nworldwide to improve its quality and will continue to do so\\\\n[1].\\\\nIt is also important to mention that when discussing\\\\ncomputational decision making in the healthcare sector, it is\\\\nnot always about detecting or predicting diseases, bio-\\\\nmedicine, biomedical image analysis, etc., but also about\\\\nhow to perform medical treatment research, patient care,\\\\nallocating resources, managing hospital volume, public\\\\nhealth policymaking, and much more. As an example, when\\\\nconsidering the current situation that has arisen with\\\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, it could be seen that all the afore-\\\\nmentioned points need to be considered in healthcare and\\\\nthose tasks need to be performed within a considerably small\\\\ntime period. Terefore, the best approach is to use machine\\\\nlearning-based decision making in the healthcare sector in\\\\nsuch times. Tis is the reason why there is a demand for the\\\\narea ‚Äúemergency machine learning‚Äù in the present world [2].\\\\nEven though artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence is set to make trans-\\\\nformation by playing an important role in healthcare, there\\\\nare a few ethical aspects as well that need to be considered\\\\nwhen implementing such systems and obtaining decisions\\\\nfrom them. Few of the ethical issues are the accountability\\\\nand transparency of the decisions made by such systems, the\\\\npotential for group harms arising from algorithmic bias and\\\\nthe professional roles, and the integrity of the clinicians.\\\\nTerefore, it is important to give consideration when\\\\nimplementing such systems and balance them with the\\\\nbeneÔ¨Åt that they create with more eÔ¨Écient healthcare sys-\\\\ntems by the high and accurate computational power of\\\\nartiÔ¨Åcial intelligence at a considerably low cost. Moreover,\\\\nalgorithms in artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence have the capacity to\\\\nperform computerized predictive analysis by Ô¨Åltering, or-\\\\ndering, and searching for patterns from big datasets from\\\\nmultiple sources to provide fast and informed decisions. In\\\\nthe present context, due to this discussed matter, most ju-\\\\nrisdictions do not allow directly applying these algorithms to\\\\nmake the Ô¨Ånal decisions, but instead use them as an aid for\\\\ndiagnosis [3].\\\\nTroughout the paper many machine learning algo-\\\\nrithms and their applications in the Ô¨Åeld of computational\\\\ndecision making for healthcare will be discussed along with\\\\nthe methods that are used to improve the eÔ¨Éciency of the\\\\nalgorithms with the objective to highlight the importance of\\\\nscalable machine learning algorithms in healthcare appli-\\\\ncations. Te aim of the paper is to discuss the involvement of\\\\nmachine learning algorithms in the healthcare sector to\\\\nperform computational decision making starting from the\\\\ninitial phase where machine learning was introduced to\\\\ncomputational biology till the peak it currently stands which\\\\nis the introduction of precision medicine to the Ô¨Åeld of\\\\nbiomedicine. Tis paper is organized in diÔ¨Äerent sections.\\\\nMachine learning approaches and algorithms that are being\\\\napplied in healthcare for decision making will be discussed\\\\nin Section 2 followed by the applications of machine learning\\\\nin the healthcare sector in various aspects such as disease\\\\nprediction\\\\nand\\\\ndetection,\\\\nmedical\\\\nimaging,\\\\nmachine\\\\nlearning in biomedicine, biomedical event extraction, ma-\\\\nchine learning approaches to polypharmacology, and ma-\\\\nchine learning for drug repurposing using system biology.\\\\nTe discussion section will include an evaluation and\\\\ncomparison of machine learning algorithms with regard to\\\\nthe applications of these algorithms in healthcare which will\\\\nbe followed by recognition of diÔ¨Äerent mechanisms used to\\\\nenhance the accuracy of the algorithms within applications,\\\\nalong with further information on the involvement of\\\\nscalable machine learning algorithms for computational\\\\ndecision making in healthcare. Te latter part of the paper\\\\nconsists of the conclusion.\\\\n2. Machine Learning Approaches\\\\nand Algorithms\\\\nMachine learning can be introduced as a scientiÔ¨Åc discipline\\\\nthat focuses on how computers learn from data and con-\\\\ntinuously improve themselves. It is mainly based on prob-\\\\nability and statistics. But it is more powerful than the\\\\nstandard statistical methodologies when it comes to decision\\\\nmaking. Information gathered from a dataset which is being\\\\ngiven to the algorithm is called features. Te accuracy of the\\\\npredictions made by the model is dependent on the quality\\\\nof the features provided to the algorithm. It is the duty of a\\\\nmachine learning developer to detect the subset of features\\\\nthat could best Ô¨Åt the purpose, increasing the accuracy of the\\\\nmodel. Tis is not an easy task. Continuous experiments\\\\nshould be carried out to identify the said feature subset for\\\\nthe algorithm. When considering putting a machine\\\\nlearning algorithm to applications, there are basically three\\\\nsteps to follow, which are training, testing, and validation.\\\\nTraining is important as the accuracy of the results will be\\\\ndepending on the training dataset. Using the test dataset, the\\\\nperformance of the algorithm will be measured. When using\\\\nthe test data for measuring the performance, it is also\\\\n2\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\nimportant to lower the bias and to increase the variance in\\\\nthis testing period. A good machine learning algorithm must\\\\noptimize the bias-variance trade-oÔ¨Ä. Te evaluation of the\\\\nÔ¨Ånal machine learning algorithm performance is done based\\\\non the validation dataset in the validation period [4]. As a\\\\nstart, it would be better to have an idea about various ap-\\\\nproaches taken in machine learning along with several al-\\\\ngorithms that are being used excessively for clustering and\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åcation purposes in machine learning.\\\\n2.1. Supervised Learning. In supervised learning, a training\\\\nset is provided with appropriate objectives in this approach.\\\\nClassiÔ¨Åcation and regression are the two categories found in\\\\nsupervised learning. In classiÔ¨Åcation, with the use of clas-\\\\nsiÔ¨Åcation methods, the trained system allocates inputs into\\\\nclasses. In regression, the sources are continuous rather than\\\\ndiscrete. Te root-mean-squared error is being used to\\\\nevaluate regression predictions, while accuracy is being used\\\\nto\\\\nevaluate\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åcation\\\\npredictions.\\\\n[5].\\\\nSupervised\\\\nlearning has the goal of predicting a known output based on\\\\na common dataset. Tasks performed by supervised learning\\\\ncan most of the time be performed by a trained person as\\\\nwell. Supervised learning focuses on classiÔ¨Åcation which\\\\ninvolves choosing among subgroups to best describe a new\\\\ninstance of data and prediction, which involves estimating\\\\nan unknown parameter. Tis is often used to estimate and\\\\nmodel risk while Ô¨Ånding relationships which are not readily\\\\nvisible to humans [6]. Below are a few supervised learning\\\\nalgorithms which are widely used in the Ô¨Åeld of computa-\\\\ntional biology and biomedicine.\\\\n2.1.1. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN). KNN is a popular su-\\\\npervised classiÔ¨Åcation algorithm which is used in many Ô¨Åelds\\\\nsuch as pattern recognition, intrusion detection, and so on.\\\\nKNN is a simple algorithm which is easy to understand. Even\\\\nthe accuracy is high in KNN, but the issues are that it is\\\\ncomputationally expensive and it has a high memory re-\\\\nquirement as both testing and training data need to be stored\\\\n[7]. A prediction for a new instance is obtained by Ô¨Ånding\\\\nthe most similar instances at Ô¨Årst and then summarizing the\\\\noutput variable according to those similar instances. For\\\\nregression, this can be the mean value, and for classiÔ¨Åcation,\\\\nthis may be the mode value. To determine the similar in-\\\\nstance, the distance measure is used. Euclidean distance is\\\\nthe most popular approach used to calculate the distance.\\\\nTe training dataset should be vectors in a multidimensional\\\\nfeature space, each with a class label [5].\\\\n2.1.2. Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a supervised\\\\nmachine learning algorithm which is used to address mainly\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åcation problems but also used for regression issues. In\\\\nthis algorithm, initially, the data items are plotted as points\\\\nin an n-dimensional space with the feature value being the\\\\nparticular coordinate. Ten, it identiÔ¨Åes the hyperplane that\\\\nseparates the datapoints into two classes. By this, the\\\\nmarginal distance between the decision hyperplane and\\\\ninstances that are close to the boundary can be maximized\\\\n[5].What brings SVM ahead of other algorithms is that it has\\\\nbasic functions that can map points to other dimensions by\\\\nusing nonlinear relationships [8]. As it divides the data-\\\\npoints to two classes, SVM is also known as the non-\\\\nprobabilistic binary classiÔ¨Åer. SVM has more accuracy when\\\\ncompared with many other algorithms. But it is best suited\\\\nfor problems with small datasets. Te reason is that when the\\\\ndataset keeps on getting larger, the training becomes more\\\\ncomplex and time consuming. When data have noise, it\\\\ncannot perform well. To make the classiÔ¨Åcation more eÔ¨É-\\\\ncient, SVM uses a subset of training points. SVM is capable\\\\nof solving both linear and nonlinear problems, but nonlinear\\\\nSVM is preferred over linear SVM as it has better perfor-\\\\nmance [7].\\\\n2.1.3. Decision Trees (DTs). DT is a supervised algorithm\\\\nwhich has a tree like model where decisions, possible\\\\nconsequences, and their outcomes are being considered.\\\\nEach node carries a question, and each branch represents an\\\\noutcome. Te leaf nodes are class labels. When a leaf node is\\\\nbeing reached by a sample data, the label of the corre-\\\\nsponding node will be assigned to the sample. Tis approach\\\\nis suited when the problem is simple and when the dataset is\\\\nsmall. Even though the algorithm is easy to understand, it\\\\nhas certain issues such as the overÔ¨Åtting problem and biased\\\\noutcomes when working with imbalanced datasets. But DTis\\\\ncapable of mapping both linear and nonlinear relationships\\\\n[7].\\\\n2.1.4. ClassiÔ¨Åcation and Regression Trees (CARTs). CART is\\\\na predictive model from which the output value is predicted\\\\nbased on the existing values in the constructed tree. Te\\\\nrepresentation for the CARTmodel is a binary tree in which\\\\neach root represents a single input and a split point on that\\\\nvariable. Leaf nodes contain an output which is used to make\\\\npredictions [5].\\\\n2.1.5. Logistic Regression (LR). LR is a popular mathematical\\\\nmodelling procedure which is used for epidemiologic\\\\ndatasets in the area of machine learning. It Ô¨Årst calculates\\\\nusing the logistic function. Ten, it learns the coeÔ¨Écients for\\\\nthe logistic regression model and then Ô¨Ånally makes pre-\\\\ndictions using that logistic regression model [9]. Tis model\\\\nis a generalized linear model and has two parts, namely,\\\\nlinear part and link function. Te linear part is responsible\\\\nfor carrying out the calculations of the classiÔ¨Åcation model,\\\\nand the link function is responsible for delivering the output\\\\nof the calculation [10]. LR is a supervised machine learning\\\\nalgorithm which needs a hypothesis and a cost function. It is\\\\nto be noted that optimizing the cost function is important\\\\n[11].\\\\n2.1.6. Random Forest Algorithm (RFA). RFA is a trending\\\\nmachine learning technique which is capable of both re-\\\\ngression and classiÔ¨Åcation [12]. It is a supervised learning\\\\nalgorithm in which the ground methodology is recursion. In\\\\nthis algorithm, a group of decision trees are being created\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\n3\\\\nand the bagging method is used for training purposes [13].\\\\nRFA is insensitive to noise and can be used for imbalanced\\\\ndatasets. Te problem of overÔ¨Åtting is also not prominent in\\\\nRFA [7].\\\\n2.1.7. Naive Bayes (NB). NB is a classiÔ¨Åcation algorithm\\\\nwhich is used for binary and multiclass problems. Te NB\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åers are a collection of classifying algorithms that are\\\\nbased on the Bayes theorem. But they all adhere to a\\\\ncommon principle which is every pair of features being\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åed must be independent of each other [5]. Tis is a bit\\\\nsimilar to SVM, but the process takes advantage from sta-\\\\ntistical methods. In this method, when there is a new input,\\\\nthe probabilistic value will be calculated among the classes\\\\nwith regard to the given input and the data will be labelled\\\\nwith the class which has the highest probabilistic value for\\\\nthe given input [9].\\\\n2.1.8. ArtiÔ¨Åcial Neural Network (ANN). ANN is a supervised\\\\nmachine learning approach which is well known for image\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åcation problems. In machine learning, artiÔ¨Åcial\\\\nneurons are considered to be the basic concept of ANN and\\\\nit is similar to a biological neural network. Tere are 3 layers\\\\nin an ANN, and every node in each layer is connected with\\\\nall the nodes in the other layers. By increasing the number of\\\\nhidden layers, a deeper neural network can be created [14].\\\\nIn neural networks, there are three types of functions. Error\\\\nfunction will determine how good or bad the output was for\\\\na given set of inputs. Te search function will identify the\\\\nchanges that would reduce the error function. Update\\\\nfunction will determine how the changes will be made as per\\\\nthe search function. Tis is an iterative process that would\\\\nimprove the performance of the algorithm [8].\\\\n2.2.UnsupervisedLearning. When a developer does not have\\\\na clear understanding of the data that are involved with the\\\\nsystem, it is not possible to label the data and provide them\\\\nas the training dataset. In these cases, the machine learning\\\\nalgorithms themselves can be used to detect similarities and\\\\ndiÔ¨Äerences between the data objects. Tis is the unsupervised\\\\napproach of machine learning. In this method, existing\\\\npatterns will be identiÔ¨Åed and the data will be clustered\\\\naccording to the identiÔ¨Åed patterns [4]. Terefore, in un-\\\\nsupervised learning, the system makes decisions without\\\\nbeing trained by a dataset as no labelled data are being given\\\\nto the system which could be used for predictions [5]. It is to\\\\nbe noted that unsupervised learning is an attempt to Ô¨Ånd\\\\nnaturally occurring patterns or groups within data. Te\\\\nchallenging part in it is to Ô¨Ånd whether the recognized\\\\npatterns or groups are useful in some way. Tis is the reason\\\\nfor unsupervised learning to play a major role in precision\\\\nmedicine. As a simple example, when grouping individuals\\\\naccording to their genetics, environment, and medical\\\\nhistory, certain relationships among them which were not\\\\nvisible before might get identiÔ¨Åed by unsupervised machine\\\\nlearning algorithms [6]. K-means, mean shift, aÔ¨Énity\\\\npropagation, density-based spatial clustering of applications\\\\nwith noise (DBSCAN), Gaussian mixture modelling, Mar-\\\\nkov random Ô¨Åelds, iterative self-organizing data (ISO-\\\\nDATA), and fuzzy C-means systems are a few examples for\\\\nunsupervised algorithms [8].\\\\nClustering is an approach in unsupervised learning, and\\\\nit can be used for dividing inputs into clusters. But these\\\\nclusters are not identiÔ¨Åed initially but are grouped based on\\\\nresemblance [5]. In clustering, the root approaches are\\\\nseparated as per the diÔ¨Äerent features that they carry. Tey\\\\ncan be partitioning (k-means), hierarchical, grid-based,\\\\ndensity-based, or model-based, and they can be further\\\\ndivided as numerical, discrete, and mixed data types. In-\\\\nheritance relationships between clustering algorithms within\\\\nan approach show common features and improvements that\\\\nthey make on each other. Speed, minimal parameters, ro-\\\\nbustness to noise, outliers, redundancy handling, and object\\\\norder independence are the desired clustering features which\\\\nare required in a clustering algorithm to be implemented\\\\nwithin a biomedical application [15]. Clustering algorithms\\\\nare used when datasets are too large and complex for manual\\\\nanalysis. Terefore, they must be fast and they must not be\\\\naÔ¨Äected by redundant sequences. It is important to evaluate a\\\\nclustering algorithm to know whether it is suitable for the\\\\nproblem in hand by considering features such as\\\\n(1) Scalability: runtime\\\\nand\\\\nmemory\\\\nrequirements\\\\nshould not exceed when working with large datasets.\\\\n(2) Robustness: ability to detect outliers that are diÔ¨Äerent\\\\nfrom the rest of the samples.\\\\n(3) Order insensitivity: the order that the inputs are\\\\ngiven should not be aÔ¨Äecting the Ô¨Ånal output.\\\\n(4) Minimum\\\\nuser-speciÔ¨Åed\\\\ninput:\\\\nthe\\\\nminimum\\\\nnumber of parameters that should be provided.\\\\n(5) Mixed data types: the objects provided may have\\\\ndiÔ¨Äerent data types.\\\\n(6) Arbitrary-shaped cluster: ability to Ô¨Ånd arbitrary-\\\\nshaped clusters.\\\\n(7) Point proportion admissibility: duplicating objects\\\\nand reclustering should not change the result [15].\\\\nWhen giving concern to the above factors, it is to be\\\\nnoted that as a result of the use of unsupervised machine\\\\nlearning in healthcare, when a patient is being diagnosed for\\\\na speciÔ¨Åc disease, in that process itself the patient will be\\\\nidentiÔ¨Åed of another disease as well if any such disease is\\\\npresent. Te reason is that the algorithm has learnt itself on\\\\nfacts that need to be considered for various types of diseases\\\\nand it analyses the given data and categorizes as diseases\\\\naccording to those data. In addition, even though various\\\\nreports taken to identify diseases may include diÔ¨Äerent types\\\\nof data, using this approach, all these data can be analysed\\\\nsimultaneously which is of much convenience and also time\\\\nsaving. With regard to the aforementioned aspects, there is\\\\nno doubt that healthcare decision making is highly beneÔ¨Åted\\\\nfrom the unsupervised machine learning approach.\\\\n2.2.1. Partition Clustering. In partition clustering, the ob-\\\\njects are partitioned and may change clusters based on the\\\\n4\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\ndissimilarity. It is useful in bioinformatics when the number\\\\nof clusters is decided such as for a small gene expression\\\\ndataset. Te drawback is that the user needs to manually\\\\nenter the number of clusters as an input. But this approach is\\\\ncommonly\\\\nused\\\\nin\\\\nbioinformatics.\\\\nFuzzy\\\\nk-means,\\\\nCOOLCAT, clustering large applications (CLARA), and\\\\nclustering large applications based on randomized search\\\\n(CLARANS) are a few examples for partition clustering\\\\nalgorithms [15].\\\\n2.2.2. Graph-Based Clustering. Graph-based clustering is\\\\nused in interactomes to make complex predictions and to\\\\nsequence networks. Tis approach is often slow and sensitive\\\\nto user-speciÔ¨Åed parameters. super-paramagnetic clustering\\\\n(SPC), Markov cluster algorithm (MCL), molecular complex\\\\ndetection (MCODE), and restricted neighbourhood search\\\\ncluster (RNSC) are a few examples for graph-based clus-\\\\ntering algorithms [15].\\\\n2.2.3. Hierarchical Clustering. In hierarchical clustering, the\\\\nobjects are partitioned into a tree of nodes and these nodes\\\\nare considered as clusters. Tere are parent nodes and child\\\\nnodes. A node could have just one parent, and each node can\\\\nhave zero or more child nodes. Tis approach is popular in\\\\nbioinformatics as clusters can be navigated at various levels\\\\nof granularity. Te drawbacks are that they are often slow,\\\\nerrors made when merging clusters cannot be undone even\\\\nthough it aÔ¨Äects the result, and if large clusters are merged,\\\\nthen interesting local cluster structure may be lost. Tis\\\\napproach is used to represent protein sequence family re-\\\\nlationships and also could be used to show gene relations\\\\nreÔ¨Çecting their gene similarity. Chameleon, robust clustering\\\\nusing\\\\nlinks\\\\n(ROCK),\\\\nscalable\\\\ninformation\\\\nbottleneck\\\\n(LIMBO), and spectral are a few examples for hierarchical\\\\nclustering algorithms [15].\\\\n2.2.4. Density-Based Clustering. Density-based clustering\\\\nuses a local density criterion, and the clusters are subspaces\\\\nin which the objects are dense and are separated by sub-\\\\nspaces of low density. It is used in bioinformatics to Ô¨Ånd the\\\\ndensest subspaces in interactome networks, typically in-\\\\nvolving cliques. Time eÔ¨Éciency and the ability to Ô¨Ånd\\\\nclusters of arbitrary shapes are the advantages of this ap-\\\\nproach. Some of these algorithms accept user parameters,\\\\nbut it is not the number of clusters. Ordering points to\\\\nidentify the clustering structure (OPTICS), clustering in\\\\nquest (CLIQUE), density based clustering (DENCLUE), and\\\\nclustering categorical data using summaries (CACTUS) are a\\\\nfew examples for density-based clustering algorithms [15].\\\\n2.2.5. Model-Based Clustering. In model-based clustering, it\\\\nis assumed that objects match a model which is often a\\\\nstatistical distribution. Te model can be user speciÔ¨Åed using\\\\na parameter, and this model can even be changed in the\\\\nprocess. Tis approach can be found in bioinformatics to\\\\nintegrate background knowledge into gene expressions,\\\\ninteractomes, and sequences. Slow processing time on large\\\\ndatasets is a drawback of this method. If the user assump-\\\\ntions are false when deÔ¨Åning the models, then the results will\\\\nalso be inaccurate. SVM-based clustering, COBWEB, and\\\\nAutoClass are a few model-based clustering algorithms [15].\\\\n2.3.SemisupervisedLearning. For semisupervised learning, a\\\\npartial training set of data is provided. Tis type of training is\\\\nused when some missing results could be targeted by some\\\\ntraining data. Semisupervised learning algorithms are\\\\ntrained on both labelled and unlabelled data. Due to this\\\\nreason, it exhibits the features of both supervised and un-\\\\nsupervised machine learning algorithms [16].\\\\n2.4. Evolutionary Learning. Evolutionary learning is mainly\\\\nused in the biology Ô¨Åeld to learn about biological organisms\\\\nand predict their survival rate. Using this method, the level\\\\nof correctness of a result can also be predicted [16].\\\\n2.5. Active Learning. In active learning, the system gets the\\\\ntraining tags only for a restricted set of occurrences. By using\\\\nit, the optimality of the substances can be enhanced to gain\\\\ntags for the required goal. Te advantage in this approach is\\\\nthat the algorithm not only continuously learns but also gets\\\\nthe facts which were self-learnt approved either by querying\\\\na user or an information source in an interactive manner. It\\\\nis something similar to budget functions in an organization\\\\nand is a modern machine learning approach for decision\\\\nmaking [16].\\\\n2.6. Deep Learning. Deep learning is an advanced phase of\\\\nmachine learning which evolves around neural networks for\\\\nlearning and predicting data. Using this approach, complex\\\\ngeneralized systems can be implemented which are able to\\\\naccept any type of problem and give predictions regarding it\\\\n[16].\\\\n2.7. Reinforcement Learning. In reinforcement learning, the\\\\ntraining data are provided only as a response to the pro-\\\\ngram‚Äôs activities in a self-motivated situation. It has a\\\\ncontinuous learning process from the environment in an\\\\niterative fashion [13].\\\\nAfter discussing several machine learning approaches, it\\\\nwould be better to list down a few examples on the appli-\\\\ncations of machine learning in the Ô¨Åeld of biomedicine so\\\\nthat this review will be interesting from the very beginning.\\\\nIn neuroscience, machine learning classiÔ¨Åers are being used\\\\nto study functional and structural dynamics of the brain.\\\\nMachine learning approaches are used in cancer prediction\\\\nand prognosis. SVM classiÔ¨Åers are used to detect prostate\\\\ncancer. Hierarchical clustering has been used in investiga-\\\\ntion of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. ANN has been used in classi-\\\\nfying diÔ¨Äerent subtypes of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures\\\\n[4]. With the knowledge gathered on various machine\\\\nlearning approaches and machine learning algorithms which\\\\nare mostly connected with computational biology and\\\\nbiomedicine, now it is time to dive into deeper knowledge\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\n5\\\\nand to identify the applications of these algorithms in the\\\\ndiscussing Ô¨Åeld.\\\\n3. Machine Learning in Disease Prediction\\\\nand Detection\\\\nVarious machine learning approaches have been imple-\\\\nmented to predict or detect a disease at its early stages so that\\\\nthe treatment for it would be less complex and it would\\\\nincrease the probability of the patient being cured. As a\\\\nresult of these approaches, diÔ¨Äerent types of diseases have\\\\nbeen detected but with diverse accuracy levels depending on\\\\nfactors such as the used algorithm, feature set, training\\\\ndataset, and so on. In this section, a few selected diseases will\\\\nbe discussed as examples, along with the importance of\\\\nidentifying a disease at the earliest, the machine learning\\\\nmethods implemented to detect the disease, and the features\\\\nthat were considered to make predictions. A descriptive\\\\ncomparison of the machine learning approaches which have\\\\nbeen implemented will be conducted in the discussion\\\\nsection of the paper, followed by suggestions to further\\\\nimprove them.\\\\n3.1.Cancer. Human body has the right count of cells of each\\\\ntype. Cancer begins with abrupt changes in the cell orga-\\\\nnization. Signals which are being generated by cells deter-\\\\nmine the control and division of cells. When these signals\\\\nbecome faulty, cells multiply too much which form a lump\\\\ncalled tumour. Nowadays, thermography is more reliable as\\\\nit is noninvasive and nonionizing. With the emerging\\\\ntechnology, it has been producing eÔ¨Écient and positive\\\\nresults which have made it superior over other technologies.\\\\nFrom the thermographic images, with the use of feature\\\\nextraction techniques and machine learning techniques, the\\\\npresence of cancer cells can be detected. Scale invariant\\\\nfeature transform (SIFT) and speeded up robust feature\\\\n(SURF) techniques can be used to extract features from\\\\nimages. Using principal component analysis (PCA), the\\\\nfeatures could be further Ô¨Åltered in order to make better\\\\ninterpretations [7].\\\\n3.1.1. Breast Cancer. Breast cancer is a type of cancer that is\\\\nmostly seen in women and is a leading cause for women‚Äôs\\\\ndeath. But this can be reduced by early detection of can-\\\\ncerous cells by tests like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),\\\\nmammogram, ultrasound, and biopsy. Breast cancer is di-\\\\nagnosed by classifying the tumour. Tumours can be either\\\\nbenign or malignant. It is to be noted that malignant tu-\\\\nmours are more harmful than benign tumours. But it is not\\\\nan easy task for physicians to distinguish among these tu-\\\\nmours. Tis makes machine learning algorithms important\\\\nas they can automatically learn and improve from the ex-\\\\nperiences without being explicitly programmed [5].\\\\nIn the past years, many machine learning techniques\\\\nwere developed for breast cancer detection and classiÔ¨Åca-\\\\ntion. Teir process could be analysed in three stages which\\\\nare preprocessing, feature extraction, and classiÔ¨Åcation.\\\\nFeature extraction stage is important as it helps in\\\\ndiscriminating between benign and malignant tumours.\\\\nTen, the image properties such as smoothness, coarseness,\\\\ndepth, and regularity are extracted using segmentation [17].\\\\nNormally, images are converted to binary to extract\\\\nuseful information. But it has been observed that once doing\\\\nso, some important features in the image vanished which\\\\nomits crucial information. Tis has led to keeping the images\\\\nin the grey scale format. Using discrete wavelet transfor-\\\\nmation (DWT), the images can be transformed from the\\\\ntime domain to the frequency domain. Tis wavelet de-\\\\ncomposition contains four matrices which are the approx-\\\\nimation coeÔ¨Écient matrix, the horizontal detailed coeÔ¨Écient\\\\nmatrix, the vertical detailed coeÔ¨Écient matrix, and the di-\\\\nagonal detailed coeÔ¨Écient matrix. Tese are the values that\\\\nwill be used for the machine learning algorithms [11].\\\\n3.1.2. Lung Cancer. Lung cancer can initiate in the wind-\\\\npipe, main airway, or lungs. People with emphysema and\\\\nprevious chest problems have a higher probability of being\\\\ndiagnosed with lung cancer. Tobacco, smoking, and air\\\\npollution can be a few major risk factors for lung cancer.\\\\nLung cancer starts in the lungs at the primary stage and\\\\nspreads to other organs as the secondary stage. Symptoms of\\\\nlung cancer will not be shown until the disease is quite\\\\nadvanced. Tat is what makes it more dangerous [9].\\\\nComputerized tomography (CT) reports are less noisy as\\\\ncompared to MRI and X-ray reports. Grayscale conversion,\\\\nnoise reduction, binarization, and segmentation techniques\\\\nare important to get the image in the required form with less\\\\nnoise and distortion. When converting to grey scale, the\\\\naverage of RGB is taken. Te median Ô¨Ålter is used for noise\\\\nreduction. Segmentation removes unnecessary details from\\\\nthe images and locates the objects and the boundaries. In\\\\nfeature extraction stage, features such as area, perimeter, and\\\\neccentricity are considered [18].\\\\nSmall-cell lung cancer (SCLC) detection is extremely\\\\ndiÔ¨Écult for human as it is almost identical to the one\\\\nwithout. Tis is where the machine learning algorithms\\\\nsuch as convolution neural network- (CNN-) based deep\\\\nlearning methods could be used in detecting SCLC.\\\\nUsually, deep learning algorithms require large training\\\\ndatasets which is an issue. Entropy degradation method\\\\n(EDM) can be used to overcome the said matter. Te\\\\ntraining data and testing data need to be high-resolution\\\\nlung CTscans. EDM carries the concept of shallow neural\\\\nnetwork where vectorized histograms are converted to\\\\nscores. Ten, the scores are transformed to probability\\\\nusing logistic function. In this approach, SCLC detection\\\\nis considered as a binomial problem which contains only\\\\ntwo groups: either a healthy person or a lung cancer\\\\npatient. So, initially test data are also given with both\\\\nthese types. Tis approach is reasonably accurate but not\\\\nthe best, and there is a large space to be further improved.\\\\nBut it is recommended that it could be further improved\\\\nby providing a larger training set and a deeper network.\\\\nBy combining with CNN, the image processing is also\\\\nfurther improved for better detection as CNN is being\\\\nused in many applications of CT imaging [19].\\\\n6\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\n3.1.3. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia. Acute lymphoblastic\\\\nleukaemia (ALL) is a type of cancer where a large number of\\\\nimmature lymphocyte blood cells develop and they aÔ¨Äect the\\\\nproduction of other blood cells. Tis progresses rapidly and\\\\ncan be very fatal within a month or a week. Pale colour of\\\\nskin, patient feeling very tired, lymph node getting enlarged,\\\\nfever, and joint pain are a few symptoms that were identiÔ¨Åed\\\\nin the patients who were diagnosed with ALL. Machine\\\\nlearning algorithms play a vital role when trying to auto-\\\\nmatically segment and classify microscopic images to detect\\\\nleukaemia.\\\\nTere have been various machine learning algorithms\\\\nused for leukaemia detection such as KNN, SVM, NB, radial\\\\nbasis function network (RBFN), and multilayer perceptron\\\\n(MLP). But in all these approaches, there are basically four\\\\nsections which are preprocessing, feature extraction, clas-\\\\nsiÔ¨Åcation model building, and evaluation of the classiÔ¨Åer. In\\\\nthe preprocessing stage, cropping of the image will be done\\\\nso that the region of interest (ROI) is clearly visible and the\\\\nunwanted information is eliminated. Using the Gaussian\\\\nblur smoothing technique, the images can be further pro-\\\\ncessed to enhance the picture by reducing the noise. In the\\\\nfeature extraction stage, concern is given towards colour-\\\\nbased features, geometrical features, statistical features,\\\\nHaralick texture feature, image moments, local binary\\\\npattern, and presence of adjacent cells [20].\\\\n3.2. Diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic disease, and it needs to\\\\nbe identiÔ¨Åed at the early stages for correct medication.\\\\nDiabetes is caused when the sugar ratio in blood increases.\\\\nTis makes the life complicated for the patients due to many\\\\nreasons. Diabetes can be classiÔ¨Åed under three types, namely,\\\\ndiabetes 1, diabetes 2, and gestation diabetes.\\\\nDiscriminant analysis (DA) is a procedure in which the\\\\nclass label of an input is determined by a series of equations\\\\nthat are obtained by input features. Normally, DA uses two\\\\npossible objectives which are Ô¨Ånding a related equation for\\\\nclassifying test samples and interpretation of the predictive\\\\nequation to better understand the relationship among fea-\\\\ntures. Being pregnant, the weight of the patient, blood\\\\npressure, glucose concentration, the ratio of insulin in blood,\\\\ndiabetes pedigree function (DPF), skinfold thickness, and\\\\npatient age are some features which can be considered for\\\\nthe classiÔ¨Åcation [10].\\\\nBy using machine learning algorithms such as Gaussian\\\\nNaive Bayes (GNB), LR, KNN, CART, RFA, and SVM along\\\\nwith variables in electronic medical records (EMRs) such as\\\\nserum-glucose1, serum-glucose2 levels, body mass index\\\\n(BMI), age, race, gender, creatinine level, and so on, pre-\\\\ndiction of type 2 diabetics was possible [21]. Time to time\\\\nvarious machine learning techniques were used to try and\\\\nimprove the accuracy of the predictions made. One ap-\\\\nproach was made using neural networks. In this method, a\\\\nfeed-forward neural network was trained by a back-\\\\npropagation algorithm. Even in this approach, the features\\\\nthat were considered are the number of pregnancies,\\\\nskinfold thickness, serum-insulin, BMI, DPF, and age and\\\\nthe main feature considered was the plasma-glucose level. It\\\\nwas observed that the predictions made by using neural\\\\nnetworks showed a higher accuracy, when compared with\\\\nother machine learning algorithms [22]. Research has been\\\\ncarried out on using deep neural networks (DNNs) as well\\\\nfor prediction of diabetics by training the DNN using Ô¨Åve-\\\\nfold and ten-fold cross validation. It is to be highlighted that\\\\nboth aforementioned approaches which were taken using\\\\nneural networks have shown an accuracy near 97% in di-\\\\nabetes prediction [23].\\\\n3.3. Heart Diseases. Heart diseases are severe events which\\\\nare caused by blockage inside the heart arteries. Chronic\\\\nheart disease is the rise of plaque inside the coronary arteries.\\\\nTis progresses slowly and could lead to a heart attack.\\\\nPeculiar glucose metabolism, extreme blood pressure, dys-\\\\nlipidaemia, smoking, lack of physical exercise, and age are\\\\nfew risk factors that have been identiÔ¨Åed for major heart\\\\ndiseases. Symptoms of a heart disease may include shortness\\\\nof breath, weakness of physical body, swollen feet and fatigue\\\\nwith related signs, and so on [14].\\\\nIn the Ô¨Åeld of cardiology, the tasks that precision\\\\nmedicine has performed include diagnostics as well as\\\\ntherapeutics in various subÔ¨Åelds. Interventional cardiology,\\\\npersonalized treatment options in correcting heart rhythms,\\\\nsome gender diÔ¨Äerences aÔ¨Äecting the outcome of cardio-\\\\nvascular diseases, and numerous works done in genomics\\\\ncan be highlighted as areas in which tasks have been per-\\\\nformed by precision medicine in cardiology. Nowadays, in\\\\nhealthcare informatics, there are services such as patient\\\\nmonitoring and clinical decision support systems (CDSSs).\\\\nWith the advancement of machine learning, now complex\\\\nproblems can be solved even by machines which was only\\\\npossible by humans, decades back. By utilizing these tech-\\\\nniques in precision medicine, the CDSS could be modiÔ¨Åed to\\\\nmake complex clinical decisions, recognizing newer phe-\\\\nnotypes and planning person-oriented specialized treatment\\\\noptions.\\\\nIn cardiology, blood tests are popular among the\\\\ndiÔ¨Äerent investigation methods in precision medicine.\\\\nAGES is a speciÔ¨Åc precision medicine test which utilizes\\\\nother factors in addition to blood tests to avoid ischemic\\\\nheart disease. In precision medicine, concern is mainly\\\\ngiven towards genetics and there are many research\\\\nstudies being carried out to Ô¨Ånd genetic causes of a\\\\ndisease. Cardiac genetics, cardiac oncology, and ischemic\\\\nheart disease can be identiÔ¨Åed as speciÔ¨Åc areas of interest\\\\nin precision cardiology. Methods such as blood tests,\\\\ngenetics tests, image tests, or even a combination of them\\\\nmay be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes\\\\nwhen advancing with precision medicine in cardiology.\\\\nMany cardiovascular diseases have their roots embedded\\\\nin genetics. Terefore, solutions using precision medicine\\\\nare considered more productive specially in these types of\\\\ndiseases. CNN, recurrent neural network (RNN), natural\\\\nlanguage processing (NLP), SVM, and long short-term\\\\nmemory (LSTM) are few machine learning techniques\\\\nwhich could be used eÔ¨Éciently to make precise CDSS\\\\nusing deep learning [24].\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\n7\\\\nA machine learning approach to identify cardiologic\\\\ndiseases includes preprocessing, feature selection, cross\\\\nvalidation method, machine learning classiÔ¨Åers, and clas-\\\\nsiÔ¨Åer performance evaluation. Tere are several pre-\\\\nprocessing techniques such as removing of missing values,\\\\nstandard scalar, and MinMax scalar. Feature selection is\\\\nimportant in machine learning as irrelevant features can\\\\naÔ¨Äect the classiÔ¨Åcation performance of the algorithm. By\\\\napplying feature selection prior to the classiÔ¨Åcation, the\\\\nexecution time is reduced and the accuracy of the classiÔ¨Å-\\\\ncation is increased. Tere are various feature selection al-\\\\ngorithms. Relief, Minimal Redundancy Maximal Relevance\\\\n(mRMR), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection\\\\nOperator (LASSO) are a few popular feature selection al-\\\\ngorithms [25].\\\\n3.4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). CKD is a type of a\\\\nkidney disease which gradually aÔ¨Äects the kidney func-\\\\ntionality and leads to kidney failure. CDK can be diagnosed\\\\nusing clinical data, lab tests, imaging studies, and biopsy. But\\\\nbiopsy has some disadvantages such as being invasive, costly,\\\\ntime-consuming, and sometimes being risky. Tis is where\\\\nmachine learning can be applied to overcome the afore-\\\\nmentioned disadvantages. In many disease predictions using\\\\nmachine learning, SVM was a commonly used classiÔ¨Åer. But\\\\nfor CKD, there is not much research that could be found that\\\\nuses SVM for the classiÔ¨Åcation. ANN, DT, and LR were the\\\\nmain machine learning classiÔ¨Åers used in this domain. When\\\\nobserving the obtained results, ANN showed far better\\\\nperformance when compared with DT and LR on CKD\\\\ndiagnosis [26].\\\\n3.5. Parkinson‚Äôs Disease (PD). PD is a chronic and pro-\\\\ngressive movement disorder. It has no causes, no permanent\\\\ncure, and limited treatment options. It is found that PD\\\\noccurs due to reduced production of dopamine, a chemical\\\\nthat controls movement and coordination. Tremors, rigidity,\\\\nslowness of movement, and postural instability are a few\\\\nsymptoms of PD. Abnormal writhing movement is a sig-\\\\nniÔ¨Åcant symptom of this disease. Some researchers have\\\\napplied machine learning algorithms on video recordings\\\\nand computer vision to diÔ¨Äerentiate healthy controls from\\\\nPD patients. Some researchers have also used voice samples\\\\nto diÔ¨Äerentiate healthy controls from PD patients [27]. PD\\\\nbelongs to the neurodegenerative disease category that may\\\\ndirectly or indirectly aÔ¨Äect the brain cells which will result in\\\\naÔ¨Äecting movement, speech, and other cognitive parts [28].\\\\nTe feature set for the classiÔ¨Åcation can be obtained\\\\nbased on PCA and genetic algorithm (GA). GA is inspired by\\\\nDarwin‚Äôs theory of evolution. A variable is considered as a\\\\ngene. Chromosomes are a sequence of a gene. A predeÔ¨Åned\\\\nfunction evaluates the quality of a chromosome and the\\\\nhigh-performing chromosome will be used to create the\\\\noÔ¨Äspring. Genetic operations such as mutation and cross-\\\\nover are used to create the oÔ¨Äspring. Basically, it is a\\\\ncompetition between the chromosomes in which the Ô¨Åttest\\\\nwill survive till the end. Tis is the concept which will be\\\\nbehind the feature extraction using the GA [29]. PCA is an\\\\nunsupervised linear conversion technique and a statistical\\\\ntechnique commonly used to identify new patterns in high-\\\\ndimensional data. Common applications that use PCA are\\\\nface recognition and image compression [30].\\\\n3.6. Dermatological Diseases. Dermatological diseases are\\\\ncomplex and have a large variety, and people have scarce\\\\nexpertise on it. Early detection is always preferred as it could\\\\nlead to serious outcomes. Eczema, herpes, melanoma, and\\\\npsoriasis are a few dermatological diseases which should be\\\\nidentiÔ¨Åed at the early stage to take life out of danger.\\\\nIn one approach that was taken to diagnose dermato-\\\\nlogical diseases, the Ô¨Årst phase involved data collection and\\\\ndata augmentation using images. Phase 2 is very important\\\\nas it is where the model is created and trained. In the last\\\\nphase, the image is converted to an array and the features are\\\\nbroken down using the trained model that was created.\\\\nTere are various augmentation techniques such as synthetic\\\\nminority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and computer\\\\nvision techniques like grey scaling, blurring, increasing\\\\ncontrast, changing the colour channel, sharpening, reducing\\\\nthe noise, and smoothing. When there are more instances in\\\\nthe database, it is better for the training of the model.\\\\nTraining the CNN with a large dataset overcomes the\\\\noverÔ¨Åtting problem. SVM classiÔ¨Åer is used for the predic-\\\\ntion. Te features in the Ô¨Ånal convolutional layer can be\\\\ndirectly given to the SVM as an input. But in order to do this,\\\\nthe SVM must be trained by giving the trained features from\\\\nthe Ô¨Ånal convolutional layer as the training dataset. Ten, the\\\\nSVM will convert it to vectors and store them [31].\\\\n4. Machine Learning in Medical Imaging\\\\nMedical imaging is a rapidly growing research area as it is\\\\nimportant to diagnose diseases in many instances. Several\\\\nsteps can be identiÔ¨Åed when observing the process of making\\\\npredictions from an image using machine learning. Once an\\\\nimage is given as the input, it will be divided into diÔ¨Äerent\\\\nsegments to zoom the interested area. Ten, with the use of\\\\ninformation retrieval techniques, features can be extracted\\\\nfrom those areas. Among them, the required features are\\\\nselected and the noise is removed. Finally, the classiÔ¨Åer will\\\\nclassify the extracted data and will make predictions based\\\\non the classiÔ¨Åcation.\\\\nNowadays, in the medical community, accurate diag-\\\\nnosis of a disease by processing large amounts of medical\\\\ndata is crucial. In the Ô¨Åeld of medicine and biology, there are\\\\nvarious tasks which are being carried out using machine\\\\nlearning algorithms. Distribution of data on the basis of their\\\\ncharacteristics, medical data examination, disease diagnosis\\\\nand treatment planning, data gathering and inspection,\\\\ncorrecting diagnostic of diÔ¨Äerent diseases by medical im-\\\\naging, and extracting features from medical images on\\\\ndiseases are just a few of the applications.\\\\nWhen further consideration is given towards the\\\\napplications of medical imaging, it can be observed that\\\\nmedical imaging is extensively being used to improve\\\\nplanning of surgical procedures with regard to many\\\\n8\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\ndiseases. Terefore, before discussing the involvement of\\\\nmachine learning in medical imaging, below mentioned\\\\nare a few such applications that would better explain how\\\\nmedical imaging is being applied in surgical planning to\\\\nobtain positive results while mitigating the risks.\\\\nAs the skull is one of the most complex areas in a human\\\\nbody in both anatomical and surgical perspectives, surgical\\\\nmanagement is extremely diÔ¨Écult when working with a wide\\\\nvariety of lesions. But during the last decades, the endonasal\\\\nendoscopic route was considered as a suitable approach for\\\\nseveral skull-based lesions. A main advantage is that when\\\\nperforming a skull-based surgery through the nose with the\\\\naid of an endoscope, direct visualization of neurovascular\\\\nstructures of diÔ¨Äerent areas of the skull base can be obtained\\\\nwith minimum brain displacement and manipulation. Te\\\\nendoscope also provides a wider and multiangle close-up\\\\nview which is of much importance in the surgical Ô¨Åeld [32].\\\\nFor diseases like rectal cancer, MRI plays a key role as it can\\\\naccurately depict the local extent of the cancer and generates\\\\nrelevant information required for prognoses which can\\\\ndirectly inÔ¨Çuence the choice of the optimal therapeutic\\\\nprocedure used for each individual patient which encourages\\\\nthe area of personalized medicine [33].\\\\nIt is to be noted that when image-guided surgeries are\\\\ncompared with conventional surgical approaches, image-\\\\nguided surgeries are less invasive, have more precise tar-\\\\ngeting, and have improved outcomes. Imaging is used to\\\\nplan, monitor progress, and to assess results. In neurosur-\\\\ngery, this is more crucial as the object of the surgical pro-\\\\ncedure is hard to be located and needs to be reached with\\\\nminimum damage to the healthy tissues. Apart from it, to\\\\nguide the placement of the surgical instruments and to\\\\nensure that the required tissue is being treated, medical\\\\nimaging is vital. At present, a wide variety of medical im-\\\\naging modalities are being used such as magnetic resonance\\\\nimaging,\\\\ncomputed\\\\ntomography,\\\\nultrasound,\\\\npositron\\\\nemission tomography, single-photon emission computed\\\\ntomography, Ô¨Çuoroscopy, and so on to perform diÔ¨Äerent\\\\nassessments like biopsies, tumour resection, epilepsy, vas-\\\\ncular conditions, and so on [34]. Medical image analysis is\\\\nevolving day by day with the development of technology.\\\\nTis is further assisted by 3D virtual model creation as well\\\\nto improve understanding of complex anatomy and to\\\\nprovide powerful tools for surgical planning and intra-\\\\noperative guidance. Nowadays, the use of 3D ultrasound and\\\\nfetal MRI is also becoming common in clinical practice [35].\\\\nTe interesting fact is how machine learning could be in-\\\\ntegrated with these medical imaging techniques to make\\\\nbetter decisions in surgical planning. It is to be noted that\\\\nusing machine learning, it is possible to understand hidden\\\\nrelationships which may not directly be visible to humans\\\\nwhen observing multiple data. Tis is the reason that even\\\\ndisease predictions in healthcare have been made possible\\\\nthrough machine learning approaches. Terefore, by pro-\\\\ncessing these medical image data using unsupervised ma-\\\\nchine learning techniques such as clustering, an analysis\\\\ncould be performed on the dataset which could later be\\\\nreferred by the surgeon to identify if any crucial information\\\\nhas been lost while planning the surgery or else to even\\\\nconÔ¨Årm that the decisions made on the approach of con-\\\\nducting the surgery is suitable for the considered patient.\\\\nEntities such as lesions and organs in medical images are\\\\ntoo complicated and they cannot be shown correctly with the\\\\nuse of simple mathematic solutions. Te pixel analysis in\\\\nmachine learning is used for medical image processing from\\\\nwhich certain values can be extracted directly from the\\\\nimage. Feature calculation and segmentation is not required\\\\nin pixel-based machine learning. Due to this, even an image\\\\nwith low contrast will have no issue in processing to extract\\\\ninformation. Pixel analysis utilizes longer training time\\\\nbecause of the high dimensionality of data. Histogram\\\\nequalization (HE) is an eÔ¨Écient technique which could be\\\\nused for contrast improvement. Tere are various other\\\\nextensions of HE which were implemented in order to\\\\nimprove the performance of the algorithm. Linear dis-\\\\ncriminant analysis (LDA), SVM, and DT are few machine\\\\nlearning methods used to analyse medical images. Low\\\\nbinary pattern descriptors are being implemented using\\\\nmachine learning approaches which could be used on bi-\\\\nological images. Te neural network technique is used in\\\\nmedical images to investigate the details regarding a disease.\\\\nMachine learning in medical imaging can also be found in\\\\nmedical-based expert systems [16].\\\\nCNN is one of the best models for image analysis. It has\\\\nseveral layers that could convert the input by using con-\\\\nvolution Ô¨Ålters. Tere are two sections in classiÔ¨Åcation with\\\\nregard to medical images. Tey are image classiÔ¨Åcation and\\\\nobject classiÔ¨Åcation. In image classiÔ¨Åcation, deep learning is\\\\nused to investigate clinical-related issues so that early\\\\ntreatment for the patient will be possible. In object classi-\\\\nÔ¨Åcation, the main target is to analyse more on interested\\\\nsmall chucks of the medical image. In medical image\\\\nanalysis, deep learning algorithms help in categorizing,\\\\nclassifying, and enumerating disease patterns using image\\\\nprocessing [16].\\\\nComputers have the ability of performing tasks con-\\\\nsistently and tirelessly. In the past years, machine learning\\\\nhas proved its ability to learn and master tasks which were\\\\nconsidered as too complex for machines to handle, and in\\\\nsome instances, they have been able to identify patterns\\\\nwhich are beyond human perception. When using machine\\\\nlearning on medical images, there are few terms which are\\\\nwidely used which need to be discussed. ClassiÔ¨Åcation means\\\\nlabelling or assigning a class to a group of pixels. Model is a\\\\nset of decision points which are learnt by the machine\\\\nlearning algorithm. Algorithm is the steps which have been\\\\ntaken to implement the model. Labelled data are the set of\\\\ndata which are examples for a speciÔ¨Åc class. Validation set or\\\\nthe training set is the set of data which is used to train the\\\\nsystem. Node is a part of a neural network which includes\\\\ntwo or more inputs and an activation function. A layer is a\\\\ncombination of nodes from which the outputs are computed.\\\\nSegmentation is a process of splitting the image into sections\\\\nso that more focus could be given to the split segments.\\\\nOverÔ¨Åtting is when a classiÔ¨Åer is too speciÔ¨Åc to the training\\\\nset and it is not useful as it is only familiar with those ex-\\\\namples. Having many features can lead to overÔ¨Åtting.\\\\nFeatures are the numeric values that represent the example.\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\n9\\\\nWhen it is with regard to medical images, it can be actual\\\\npixel values, edge strengths, variation in pixel values in a\\\\nregion, etc. Feature selection must be done in a way that the\\\\nselected subset of features is able to provide the best and the\\\\nmost accurate predictions [8].\\\\nImage recognition and biomedical time series classiÔ¨Å-\\\\ncation are nonlinear classiÔ¨Åcation problems. With the\\\\nexisting classiÔ¨Åcation algorithms and feature extraction\\\\ntechnologies, it is not possible to have highly complicated\\\\nnonlinear functions. But using DNN, nonlinear functions\\\\ncan be constructed by increasing the number of layers and\\\\nneurons in the network. With the use of ensemble learning,\\\\nmultiple classiÔ¨Åers could also be combined to have com-\\\\nplicated decision-making functions. Both in SVM and en-\\\\nsemble learning, nonlinear functions are constructed by\\\\ncombining multiple kernel functions. In the present context,\\\\nthe generation strategy is to later use the same learning\\\\nalgorithm. Terefore, diÔ¨Äerent settings such as learning\\\\nparameters and training samples are needed. Many methods\\\\nhave been developed having this idea, and they can be di-\\\\nvided into four categories. First is to manipulate the training\\\\nsamples. Bagging, boosting, cross-validated committees,\\\\nwagging, and arcing sort of approaches are needed for this.\\\\nTe second way is to manipulate the input features. Methods\\\\nsuch as random subspace, input decimation, and similarity-\\\\nbased feature space can be used for this purpose. Te third\\\\nway is to manipulate the class labels. Output coding and class\\\\nswitching are examples for this. Te fourth way is inserting\\\\nrandomness to the learning algorithm. Backpropagation\\\\nalgorithm, randomized Ô¨Årst-order inductive learner, and RF\\\\nare few approaches used for this. Te resulting classiÔ¨Åers\\\\nusing backpropagation will be quite diverse if diÔ¨Äerent initial\\\\nweights are applied to the same training samples in a neural\\\\nnetwork. Basically, it is visible that the underlying core of the\\\\ngeneration strategy is to make the individual classiÔ¨Åers\\\\ndiÔ¨Äerent so that it could be used to improve the classiÔ¨Åer\\\\nperformance [36].\\\\n5. Machine Learning in Biomedicine\\\\nGene expression datasets contain measurements of in-\\\\ncreasing and decreasing expression levels of a set of genes.\\\\nGene expression measurements are usually taken across time\\\\npoints from tissue samples or patients, and they are rep-\\\\nresented as a matrix of numerical values. In a protein-\\\\nprotein interaction network, the nodes represent biomole-\\\\ncules and the edges represent interactions. In any clustering\\\\nalgorithm, it is always better to have a minimum number of\\\\nuser inputs as it is hard for the users to specify correct values.\\\\nTese user inputs could aÔ¨Äect the accuracy of the algorithm\\\\nif they are incorrect [15].\\\\nNowadays, machine learning has become ubiquitous and\\\\nindispensable when it comes to solving complex problems in\\\\nmany areas. In biomedicine, machine learning is used for\\\\nvarious tasks such as to predict protein structure, function\\\\nfrom genetic sequences, discern optimal diets from patients\\\\nclinical and microbiome proÔ¨Åle, and so on. Machine\\\\nlearning is also used in processing real-time, high-resolution\\\\nphysiological data in various medical applications. Te\\\\ninvolvement of machine learning in biomedicine can be\\\\ndiscussed mainly in three approaches. First is that machine\\\\nlearning improves prognosis. Current prognostic models are\\\\nrestricted to few variables that humans must enter and tally\\\\nscores. But these data could be directly taken from EHRs and\\\\nthen it would allow models to use thousands of rich pre-\\\\ndictor variables which would increase the accuracy of the\\\\npredictions. Second is that machine learning will reduce the\\\\nwork of radiologists and anatomical pathologists. Normally,\\\\nthese physicians focus on interpreting digitalized images.\\\\nBut using machine learning algorithms, these images can be\\\\ngiven as an input, which would result in interpretations and\\\\npredictions provided by the algorithm. Sometimes, these\\\\ninterpretations even exceed the accuracy of humans. Apart\\\\nfrom it, the algorithms do not need rest, and they could work\\\\ncontinuously at the same accuracy which is not possible for\\\\nhumans in practice. Tird is that machine learning will\\\\nimprove the diagnostic accuracy by minimizing the diag-\\\\nnostic errors. But the challenge which needs to be faced here\\\\nis the complexity of training the algorithm as the predictions\\\\nare not binary. Even when working with EHR data, Ô¨Årst the\\\\ndata need to be preprocessed to be accessible to the algo-\\\\nrithms as they are often stored in an unstructured format.\\\\nData themselves are not useful, but they need to be\\\\nanalysed, interpreted, and acted on to make them useful.\\\\nAlgorithms are required to perform the aforementioned\\\\ntasks with datasets. Terefore, new statistical tools from the\\\\nmachine learning Ô¨Åeld are critical when practicing medicine\\\\nin the present time. Most of the computer-based algorithms\\\\nin medicine are expert systems. Tey have a set of rules and\\\\nknowledge which are being applied to make conclusions\\\\nwith regard to speciÔ¨Åc clinical scenarios. Tis is an approach\\\\nthat is similar to a medical student where the general\\\\nprinciples about medicine are being applied on new patients.\\\\nBut machine learning is much diÔ¨Äerent than the above\\\\ndiscussed, as in a machine learning approach, rules are being\\\\nlearnt from the data themselves. It starts with the patient\\\\nlevel observations and checks through vast number of\\\\nvariables to look for combinations that could reliably predict\\\\nthe outcome. Te highlight in machine learning is the\\\\nenormous number of predictors that it handles. Sometimes,\\\\nthere are more predictors than observations and they need to\\\\nbe combined in a nonlinear and highly interactive way to\\\\ngenerate accurate outcomes.\\\\nTruly independent validation datasets must be used from\\\\ndiÔ¨Äerent populations and periods which have no relation\\\\nwith the model development when testing the models. If not\\\\nin the validation stage, the algorithm will have poor per-\\\\nformance. Machine learning algorithms need high-quality\\\\ndata in high quantities to reach acceptable performance\\\\nlevels. If the dataset is biased, it can aÔ¨Äect the performance\\\\nand the generalizability of the algorithm. Machine learning\\\\nis not capable of solving any fundamental problems of causal\\\\ninference in the observational dataset. Even though the\\\\nalgorithm is good in predicting the outcomes, yet it is to be\\\\nnoted that these predictors are not the causes [37].\\\\nMany research studies have given binary interpretations\\\\non whether a person is being diagnosed with a particular\\\\ndisease or not. Sometimes, regarding a particular disease, it\\\\n10\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\nmay show the stage of the disease as well. It could be noticed\\\\nthat these research studies have been based on a particular\\\\ndisease, but not many diseases together. To address the said\\\\nlimitation, a method was proposed called ensemble label\\\\npower-set pruned dataset joint decomposition (ELPPJD).\\\\nTe label power-set (LP) method overcomes the indepen-\\\\ndence problem and takes the correlation among labels into\\\\nconsideration. But the issues are that the time complexity\\\\nincreases with the size of the label set and the imbalanced\\\\nproblem keeps on rising when new label sets are produced.\\\\nPruned datasets and joint decomposition can be used to\\\\novercome these issues. In this approach, when creating new\\\\nclasses, all these training data will be broken down into\\\\nsubsets which are disjoint. Ten, using a similarity threshold,\\\\nthe labels which are more similar to each other will be\\\\ngrouped. Te subset partition strategies can be size balanced\\\\n(SB) and label similarity (LS). Random K-label sets (RAKEL)\\\\nand hierarchy of multilabel classiÔ¨Åers (HOMER) are mul-\\\\ntilabel classifying methods which can be used as alternatives\\\\nfor this approach. RAKEL runs based on MEKA, and C4.5 is\\\\nthe basic classiÔ¨Åcation algorithm. HOMER runs based on\\\\nMULAN, and RF is the basic classiÔ¨Åcation algorithm.\\\\nRAKEL shows better performance than HOMER. But\\\\nELPPJD with LS partition strategy outperforms both RAKEL\\\\nand HOMER [38].\\\\n6. Machine Learning in Biomedical\\\\nEvent Extraction\\\\nTe relationship between the disease and the drug, the re-\\\\nlationship between the disease and the gene, the interaction\\\\nbetween drugs, and the interaction between proteins are\\\\nbiological events which have complex structures. To extract\\\\nthese biomedical events accurately and eÔ¨Éciently, bio-\\\\nmedical text mining technology is important as the amount\\\\nof unstructured and semistructured biomedical literature\\\\ndata is rapidly growing.\\\\nPattern-based methods are used in biomedical relation\\\\nextraction. But they are not much used in biomedical event\\\\nextraction. Event extraction systems are mainly divided into\\\\ntwo types which are rule-based event extraction systems and\\\\nmachine learning-based event extraction systems. In the\\\\nmachine learning approach, the task of extracting bio-\\\\nmedical events is considered as a classiÔ¨Åcation problem. Te\\\\nhighly unbalanced training dataset given in biomedical event\\\\nextraction is an issue, and most of the systems do not address\\\\nthis problem. But SVM addresses this issue using the simple\\\\nclass weighting strategy. Machine learning-based event ex-\\\\ntraction systems have three types. First type is the pipeline\\\\nmodel. Te pipeline model has achieved excellent results in\\\\nthe event extraction task. But the drawbacks in it are that the\\\\ntime complexity is high and each step is based on the\\\\nprevious step. Terefore, if there is an error, that error would\\\\nbe carried till the Ô¨Ånal step. Second type is the joint model.\\\\nTis model overcame the previous drawbacks discussed, yet\\\\nit involves complicated calculations. Tird type is the\\\\npairwise model. Tis is a combination of both pipeline and\\\\njoint models. Pairwise model is faster than the joint model\\\\nand more accurate than the pipeline model. Tis model uses\\\\nSVM to overcome the multiclass and multilabel classiÔ¨Åca-\\\\ntion problem without dealing with data imbalance.\\\\nA system proposed to extract biomedical events from\\\\nimbalanced data has several steps. First, text preprocessing\\\\nwill be carried out using token features, sentence features,\\\\nsentence dependency features, and external resource fea-\\\\ntures. Next is the sample selection, based on sequential\\\\npatterns. It aims to Ô¨Ånd the frequent subsequence or se-\\\\nquential events that satisfy the minimum support. Tis\\\\nincludes the extraction of sequential patterns in the text.\\\\nTen, the detection of multiargument events is performed,\\\\nfollowed by the joint scoring mechanism. Tis will result in\\\\nobtaining the outcome. Te tool sentence2vec, based on\\\\nconvolutional deep structured semantic models (C-DSSMs),\\\\nis used to calculate the semantic relevance score [39].\\\\nUsing SVM, it is possible to separate event extraction\\\\ninto multiple classiÔ¨Åcation tasks, individually detecting the\\\\ntrigger words deÔ¨Åning events and the arguments that de-\\\\nscribe which proteins or genes take part in these events. Tis\\\\nis based on labelled data and supervised learning algorithms.\\\\nBut the issue is that these systems get aÔ¨Äected by data\\\\nsparseness. Especially, it happens when the training dataset\\\\nis too small to Ô¨Ånd enough information to assign proper\\\\nweights to those low-frequency or out-of-vocabulary fea-\\\\ntures. Terefore, research was carried out to implement\\\\nsystems that would use the semisupervised or the unsu-\\\\npervised machine learning approach to extract biomedical\\\\nevents. In PubMed, a large pool of unlabelled data with\\\\npotential information with regard to the biomedical event\\\\nextraction domain can be found to go ahead with the re-\\\\nsearch. Te basic features are obtained by the labelled data\\\\nand the information which is lacking in labelled data can be\\\\nobtained from unlabelled data using the event feature\\\\ncoupling generalization strategy. Sparse features that were\\\\nÔ¨Åltered by supervised machine learning methods can be used\\\\nto increase the performance of the system while these could\\\\neven be considered when using a semisupervised machine\\\\nlearning approach for biomedical event extraction [40].\\\\nProteins are the end products of a gene expression.\\\\nUnderstanding the gene function at the proteome level is a\\\\nsigniÔ¨Åcant interest in the biological and medical research\\\\ncommunity. Tere are large repositories of protein data\\\\nwhose characteristics are unknown as noting their func-\\\\ntional features using experimental methods have lagged far\\\\nbehind. Tis creates a need of a computational method to\\\\naddress the issue by accurately working on the large datasets\\\\neven with a limited amount of labelled data. Functional,\\\\nstructural, and evolutionary characteristics of the protein\\\\ncan be extracted by using the protein sequence information.\\\\nTe aim of protein classiÔ¨Åcation is to extract this infor-\\\\nmation accurately, and it has only been possible with the\\\\napplication of machine learning algorithms to analyse the\\\\nprotein data repositories [41].\\\\n7. Machine Learning\\\\nApproaches to Polypharmacology\\\\nPolypharmacology focuses on designing medical treatment\\\\nthat can target multiple receptors. Te eÔ¨Écacy and toxicity of\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\n11\\\\ndrugs result from complex interactions between pharma-\\\\ncodynamic, pharmacokinetic, genetic, epigenetic, and en-\\\\nvironmental factors even though it may be designed as a\\\\nsingle or multitarget treatment. Machine learning-related\\\\ncomputational techniques are required to enable the pre-\\\\ndiction and analysis of in vitro and in vivo drug-response\\\\nphenotypes.\\\\nIdentiÔ¨Åcation of drug-target interaction on a proteome-\\\\nwide scale is essential to deÔ¨Åne and predict a drug response.\\\\nApart from its genetic and epigenetic variations, cell-to-cell\\\\ncommunication, cell-to-cell variability, and other environ-\\\\nmental factors must also be considered. System-based ap-\\\\nproaches help in drug discovery as they could identify\\\\ncellular connectivity between all the aforementioned com-\\\\nponents. New computational methods are needed to ac-\\\\ncurately calculate free-energy landscapes during association\\\\nand dissociation of protein-ligand complexes. It will allow to\\\\ninvestigate quantitatively both low and high aÔ¨Énity binding\\\\non a proteome-wide scale. Self-organizing map is an un-\\\\nsupervised machine learning technique that is used to cluster\\\\ndrug molecules. Prediction of drug-target interactions can\\\\nbe done by combining the sequence features of the receptor\\\\nwith the Ô¨Ångerprint of the ligand, in order to train modules\\\\nbased on statistical machine learning. Tere are four com-\\\\nputational areas which are crucial in polypharmacology, and\\\\nthey are the proteome-wide prediction of drug-target in-\\\\nteractions, the quantitative modelling of protein-ligand\\\\ninteractions, the integrated analysis of biological networks,\\\\nand the dynamic and stoichiometric simulation of biological\\\\nnetworks [42].\\\\nNGS includes both DNA and RNA sequencing. It in-\\\\nvolves the task of braking DNA and RNA into fragments and\\\\ndetermining the order of the nucleotide bases in each\\\\nfragment. DNA sequencing can either be whole genome\\\\nsequencing (WGS) or whole exome sequencing (WES) of the\\\\ncoding regions of all known genes and targeted sequencing\\\\nof genomic regions or genes implicated in a disease. WGS\\\\nand WES can be found in clinical practices to evaluate\\\\ndevelopmental brain disorders such as autism, seizures, and\\\\nintellectual disability. Tere are commercially available se-\\\\nquencing platforms which use various methods to generate\\\\nsequence data. With the continuous modiÔ¨Åcations resulted\\\\nfrom the advancement of technologies, NGS-based plat-\\\\nforms have shown a comparatively low error rate. In NGS\\\\ntechnologies, Sanger sequencing is considered to be the most\\\\naccurate sequencing method and it is often used for the\\\\nvalidation of genetic variants due to its high accuracy [43].\\\\nWhen modern machine learning is combined with\\\\nmedical practice by using clinical data sources, various\\\\nprediction models could be generated for similar clinical\\\\nquestions. From early warning systems till superhuman\\\\nimaging diagnostics, there are many applications of machine\\\\nlearning in medical practice. Machine learning methods\\\\nprovide predictions based on existing data. Te Google Ô¨Çu\\\\nreminds how forecasting an annual event based on 1 year of\\\\ndata could lead to time series problems. Having loads of data\\\\nover the past time has diminishing returns. Basically, it is\\\\nfound in research on decision support algorithms that it is\\\\nbetter to use the most recent year data instead of historical\\\\ndata of multiple years for better accurate decisions. Even\\\\nwhen evaluating prediction models, the main idea behind\\\\nthis is not about the ability to do repetitions of historical\\\\ntrends but the accuracy it has on predicting future trends. It\\\\nis true that machine learning algorithms can improve the\\\\nprediction accuracy by using conventional regression\\\\nmodels by capturing complex and nonlinear relationships in\\\\nthe data. But it is to be noted that even though highest\\\\ncomputing power is provided, there is no possibility of\\\\ngetting information that is not present. Terefore, using\\\\nclinical data alone has limited the prediction power. By\\\\nincorporating the correct data streams, the level of pre-\\\\ndiction accuracy can be improved. But not even a simple\\\\nnonlinear system can precisely predict the distant future.\\\\nTiny variations which seem nothing and very less important\\\\nrounding errors can accumulate and make a massive impact\\\\non future events [44].\\\\n8. Machine Learning for Drug Repurposing\\\\nUsing System Biology\\\\nMore than 90% of the drugs that go through the early phases\\\\nof clinical trials fail due to reasons such as adverse reactions,\\\\nside eÔ¨Äects, or lack of eÔ¨Éciency. To overcome these chal-\\\\nlenges, drug repurposing has been considered. Repurposing\\\\ndrugs can be either drug-based or disease-based. Drugs that\\\\nare strongly anticorrelated with a disease are likely to be\\\\ncandidates for repurposing. Te connectivity map was the\\\\nÔ¨Årst project that aimed to explore the functional connectivity\\\\nbetween drugs. It even considered the functional connec-\\\\ntivity between drugs and diseases. Systems biology can be\\\\nused to discover and develop drugs by giving concern to the\\\\ninteractions of the components in biological entities. Drugs\\\\nare being ranked based on the amount of perturbation they\\\\ncause on speciÔ¨Åc disease-related genes.\\\\nA drug disease network (DDN) is constructed by inte-\\\\ngrating the knowledge on disease-related genes, drug targets,\\\\nsignalling pathways, and gene-gene interactions. Te DDN\\\\nrepresents all the interactions between drug targets and\\\\ngenes, related to a given disease as described in Kyoto\\\\nEncyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signalling\\\\npathways. Te repurposing scores of the drug-disease pairs\\\\nare calculated using the Pearson correlation coeÔ¨Écient be-\\\\ntween their gene perturbation signatures, and it can take a\\\\nvalue between 1 to ‚àí1. A high positive value indicates that\\\\nthe drug and the disease both cause similar perturbations to\\\\nthe system, and a high negative value indicates that the drug\\\\nand the disease have opposite gene perturbation signatures.\\\\nBy using this value, it can be recognized whether it is a drug\\\\nthat could be considered as a treatment to a given disease\\\\n[45].\\\\nTerefore, it is clear that when a patient approaches and\\\\nexpects support from healthcare, the decision making starts\\\\nin the process of the patient being diagnosed with a disease\\\\nand it continues till the proper treatment or medication is\\\\nprescribed for the patient. In this process, which is a chain of\\\\ndecisions, to support each decision, machine learning ap-\\\\nproaches are involved in healthcare. Tasks such as predicting\\\\nor diagnosing a disease, identifying hidden diseases,\\\\n12\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\nproviding clinical decision support, and even recognizing\\\\nwhether a drug is suitable as a treatment to the given disease\\\\nare being conducted using machine learning approaches to\\\\nsupport clinicians to make fast and accurate decisions.\\\\nStepping further ahead, even after a patient is cured from a\\\\ndisease, using machine learning approaches, the EHRs of\\\\npatients are processed and analysed to identify any future\\\\nhealth risks that could possibly occur.\\\\n9. Discussion\\\\nIn this section, the main concern would be given towards\\\\nhighlighting important and crucial facts of the topics dis-\\\\ncussed throughout the paper. To start with, it is better to give\\\\nconcern towards the performance of machine learning al-\\\\ngorithms. To identify best performing algorithms, classiÔ¨Åer\\\\naccuracy and the classiÔ¨Åer log loss are two factors that can be\\\\nconsidered. Te classiÔ¨Åer accuracy needs to be high and the\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åer log loss needs to be low for an algorithm to be\\\\nidentiÔ¨Åed as a well-performing algorithm. Terefore, once\\\\nselecting a suitable algorithm to address a speciÔ¨Åc concern,\\\\nthe aforementioned factors are considered to select the al-\\\\ngorithm out of many diÔ¨Äerent existing algorithms that\\\\nwould best suit our purpose.\\\\nIn most clustering algorithms, the eÔ¨Äectiveness of the\\\\nalgorithm depends on the appropriate parameters that the\\\\nuser inputs. For example, parameters like number of ex-\\\\npected clusters, a starting point in the dataset, minimum\\\\nnumber of samples to form a cluster, and so on aÔ¨Äect the\\\\nclustering result. Tis is a serious issue when biological and\\\\nbiomedical data are considered as they are nonspherical and\\\\nhigh-dimensional. Automatic density clustering method\\\\nwith multiple kernels (ADCMK) is a proposed option to\\\\nanswer the said issue. Using that method, clusters with\\\\narbitrary shape can be easily identiÔ¨Åed based on their\\\\ndensity. When comparing the conventional clustering al-\\\\ngorithms, ADCMK automatically determines optimal values\\\\nfor the cutoÔ¨Ädistance, kernel weights, and number of\\\\nclusters and centroids which will not change the clustering\\\\nresult when executed time to time. It also has comparatively\\\\nbetter accuracy. Multiple kernel clustering approaches help\\\\nin optimally combining the learning algorithms in order to\\\\nobtain excellent clustering results and performance in\\\\nvarious scenarios. Tey are mostly suitable to handle labelled\\\\ndatasets as they are a part of supervised kernel learning.\\\\nTere is also an unsupervised multiple kernel learning ap-\\\\nproach that aims to determine the linear combination of\\\\nmultiple kernels based on an unlabelled dataset [46].\\\\nIt is not possible to exactly highlight which algorithm is\\\\nbetter than the other. Te reason is that it depends on the\\\\ndomain that the training and the tests are being executed, the\\\\ndataset that is involved in the training and testing proce-\\\\ndures, the level of preprocessing that is being performed on\\\\nthe dataset, the selected feature set for the algorithm or the\\\\nfeature selection algorithms that have been used on the\\\\ndataset, the size of the dataset and the data types in the\\\\ndataset, the performance level and the capacity of the ma-\\\\nchine, and much more. Tis makes it vital to select the\\\\nproper algorithm that would be ideal for the requirement.\\\\nNormally, this cannot be directly selected, but it will be an\\\\niterative process to select the most suitable algorithm from a\\\\nÔ¨Åltered set of algorithms which would best Ô¨Åt the problem in\\\\nhand. Te proper knowledge and past experiences gathered\\\\nwill help in constructing the Ô¨Åltered set of algorithms. When\\\\nlooking at a simple example from the biomedical Ô¨Åeld, it can\\\\nbe seen that for the diagnosis of various diseases, the best\\\\nperforming algorithm changes due to the aforementioned\\\\nreason. Tis could be further explained by looking at the\\\\nscenarios below, in detail.\\\\nMany studies have been carried out using ANN, DT,\\\\nand LR to diagnose kidney diseases, and ANN has out-\\\\nperformed both DT and LR by a huge margin [26].\\\\nAccording to previous studies, it is to be noted that the\\\\naccuracy of the results obtained with regard to lung\\\\ncancer diagnosis is in the order of SVM, ANN, and DT.\\\\nApart from them, various other techniques also have been\\\\nused and they have also showed a reasonable level of\\\\naccuracy. Tese algorithms are GA, BPNN, HopÔ¨Åeld\\\\nneural network, and LDA [30]. Another beneÔ¨Åt that could\\\\nbe gained by using SVM classiÔ¨Åcation is that through\\\\nSVM, it is possible to calculate even the stage of the lung\\\\ncancer [18]. Regression can be used to model and predict\\\\nthe association between the dependent variable and the\\\\nindependent variable. Regression can be categorized as\\\\nlinear regression and logistic regression. For linear re-\\\\ngression, the dependent variable should be continuous,\\\\nand for logistic regression, the dependent variable should\\\\nbe discrete. Using the logistic regression algorithm to\\\\npredict complex disease such as cancer must be avoided.\\\\nKNN is not suitable for cancer predictions as the datasets\\\\nare huge and more complex which could make the\\\\nclustering process more diÔ¨Écult [47]. It was found that\\\\nDNN has better performance for breast cancer detection.\\\\nTen ANN, SVM, and KNN were ranked in the given\\\\norder with regard to their performance [48]. It is to be\\\\nnoted that DNN has also shown higher accuracy in\\\\npredicting diabetics compared with the other standard\\\\nmachine learning algorithms. When discussing extract-\\\\ning of medical data from documents, datasets, databases,\\\\nmedical images, etc. for analysing purposes, various CNN\\\\nalgorithms can be used to extract features from un-\\\\nstructured data. For structured data, NB, KNN, and DT\\\\nalgorithms can be used. For textual data which are un-\\\\nstructured, CNN-based unimodal disease risk prediction\\\\n(CNN-UDRP) can be used. For both structured and\\\\nunstructured data, CNN-based multimodal disease risk\\\\nprediction (CNN-MDRP) can be used. In the CNN-\\\\nUDRP algorithm, tests are represented in the form of a\\\\nvector. For each word, the distributed representation of\\\\nthe word embedding found in NLP is used. When\\\\nworking with CNN, it is required to specify the number of\\\\nwords for the sliding window. When assigning a value for\\\\nthe sliding window, it is important to assign a value that\\\\nwould help in reaching the highest accuracy when it is\\\\nbeing used [8]. When giving concern to these aspects,\\\\nwhat could be seen is how these machine learning ap-\\\\nproaches assist in healthcare decision making of the\\\\nclinicians. When analysing reports and when going\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\n13\\\\nthrough the patients‚Äô medical history, these algorithms\\\\nare used to highlight the factors that deÔ¨Ånitely need to be\\\\nconsidered by the clinician when prescribing treatment.\\\\nIn addition to it, these algorithms are also used to assist in\\\\nidentifying the level that the disease has spread in the\\\\npatient so that the treatment can be given accordingly\\\\nbased on the disease severity.\\\\nMoving on to the next topic, which is medical imaging, it\\\\nis visible that currently, medical image classiÔ¨Åcation is\\\\nmostly based on pattern recognition methods. It has been\\\\nfound that classiÔ¨Åcation-based neural networks have better\\\\nperformance than other supervised machine learning al-\\\\ngorithms. Deep learning is considered as a combination of\\\\nboth supervised and unsupervised methods. Te reason is\\\\nthat it initially relies on unsupervised learning for training\\\\nthe DNN and then to Ô¨Åne tune the neural network, it uses\\\\nsupervised learning. When compared with various classiÔ¨Å-\\\\ncation algorithms, CNN combined with adaptive sliding\\\\nwindow fusion mechanism has good stability and robustness\\\\nalong with high classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy. Even when it is for\\\\nbreast tumour or brain tumour diagnosis, the aforemen-\\\\ntioned approach with CNN has given comparatively better\\\\nresults [49]. As both deep learning and ensemble learning\\\\ncan construct complicated nonlinear functions, by com-\\\\nbining them, it is possible to handle more complex tasks.\\\\nBiomedical time series often has interfering noise. But when\\\\ntrying to eliminate the noise, along with it some useful\\\\ninformation might also be lost. DNN has the ability to\\\\ncapture useful information while ignoring the interfering\\\\nnoise after learning from training samples. Presently, DNN\\\\nmainly includes CNN, deep belief network (DBN), and\\\\nautoencoder (AE). CNN performs convolution operations\\\\non both horizontal and vertical directions. Tis is a good\\\\napproach for image data as it is relevant in both directions.\\\\nBut for biomedical time series with multiple channels, this is\\\\nnot suitable as only horizontal direction is relevant and the\\\\nvertical direction is independent. For this reason, multi-\\\\nchannel CNN can also be implemented to obtain better\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åcation performance [36].\\\\nWhen further observed, it is also visible that in the\\\\npresent context, medical imaging has also been combined\\\\nwith the 3D printing technology to achieve greater success\\\\nspecially when surgical planning is to be considered. 3D\\\\nprinting can turn a 3D medical image dataset into a 3D\\\\nobject as per the patient‚Äôs actual size. Tis can largely im-\\\\nprove the precision of modern surgical planning by com-\\\\nbining with other preoperative plan and intraoperative\\\\nnavigation techniques. By combining these with the cloud\\\\ncomputing architecture, there is further space for im-\\\\nprovement in cost eÔ¨Éciency, Ô¨Çexibility, and clinical work-\\\\nÔ¨Çow. Terefore, further exploration needs to be done on 3D\\\\nprinting and cloud computing technologies of their usage in\\\\nthe surgical realm. Nowadays, surgeons are able to perform\\\\nrisky procedures with high level of safety and accuracy with\\\\nthe development of multimodality imaging, with regard to\\\\nespecially the fusion of functional imaging in preoperative\\\\nplanning and modern image guided therapy in intra-\\\\noperative navigation. With the development of medical\\\\nimaging technology, there are multiple imaging processing\\\\nsystems and intraoperative imaging guided platforms which\\\\nare being introduced that are powerful but also complicated\\\\n[50]. In addition to it, 3D printing has also been used to\\\\ndesign advanced prosthetic devices with the aim of devel-\\\\noping a realistic model which is closely similar to the actual\\\\npart with regard to the geometry and mechanical properties.\\\\nWhen making such products, even though the geometry can\\\\nbe easily obtained by the 3D scanned data, the mechanical\\\\nproperties need to be mechanically validated and a major\\\\nconcern should be given towards composite material\\\\ntechnology [51]. A few of the currently existing Ô¨Åndings on\\\\nprosthetic devices are brieÔ¨Çy discussed below.\\\\nTe concept of creating a soft total artiÔ¨Åcial heart from\\\\nsilicon elastomers using the lost-wax casting technique has\\\\nalso been possible as the 3D printing technology has enabled\\\\nthe production of entirely soft pumps with complex chamber\\\\ngeometries. Even though it is not yet readily implantable, it\\\\npromotes the future of personalized medicine and artiÔ¨Åcial\\\\nheart development without requiring expensive and com-\\\\nplex equipment [52]. By using an array of semiconductor\\\\nphoto detectors which are made of polymers and printed on\\\\na glass hemisphere, a 3D printed prototype of a bionic eye\\\\nhas been designed and further research is being carried out\\\\non ways to improve the eÔ¨Éciency of the photo detectors and\\\\nto Ô¨Ånd a way to print on a soft hemispherical material that\\\\ncould be implanted to a real human eye [53]. Researchers\\\\nhave also developed a 3D printed tooth that also kills bacteria\\\\nusing conventional artiÔ¨Åcial tooth resins combined with\\\\npositively charged quaternary ammonium ions [54]. In\\\\nanother study, a handheld portable printer was developed\\\\nwhich could be used to create narrow sheets of skin tissue\\\\nmade from collagen and Ô¨Åbrin to cover and heal deep\\\\nwounds. Tis printer can tailor tissues based on the patient\\\\nand the wound characteristics within two minutes or less.\\\\nFurther research is being carried out on ways to expand the\\\\nsize of the printed strips so that larger wounds could be\\\\ncovered [55]. Bioengineers have 3D printed artiÔ¨Åcial\\\\nhyperelastic bones which could quickly induce bone re-\\\\ngeneration and growth. Currently, it has been implanted\\\\nsuccessfully in animal models and a main advantage in this\\\\napproach is that the 3D printing process can customize any\\\\nshape of a bone as per the requirement and can create it\\\\nwithin a day. It is to be noted that the materials used to create\\\\nthese 3D printed bones are Ô¨Çexible, and after combining\\\\nthem with the bone structure, with time, they bond with the\\\\nexisting bones and become a part of the human body [56]. A\\\\ngroup of scientists has 3D printed a bionic ear with an\\\\nantenna and a cartilage that can hear the radio frequencies\\\\neven beyond the range of a normal human‚Äôs capability. It has\\\\nalso been created in such a way that the electrical signals\\\\nproduced from the ear can be connected with the nerve\\\\nendings which is considered to be the Ô¨Årst time that 3D\\\\nprinting was eÔ¨Äectively used to interweave tissues with\\\\nelectronics [57]. Tere are many such prosthetic devices\\\\nwhich were outcomes of previous research studies that were\\\\ncarried out, and further research is being conducted on them\\\\npresently to improve the existing results. Medical imaging,\\\\n3D printing technologies, and various other computational\\\\napproaches have been vital when conducting these research\\\\n14\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\nstudies to obtain improved results. When giving concern to\\\\nhow machine learning could be involved in these Ô¨Åndings, it\\\\nis visible that machine learning approaches could analyse\\\\nlarge biological and material datasets to identify various\\\\nrelationships which exist between the data. In addition to it,\\\\nas machine learning is used to detect diseases and the se-\\\\nverity level of it, these machine learning algorithms can be\\\\ncombined with the equipment that is being used to design\\\\nsuch prosthetic devices so that when the medical dataset is\\\\ngiven, an analysis is to be performed so that the devices can\\\\nbe customized and designed based on the patient‚Äôs re-\\\\nquirement which would further encourage the latest trend in\\\\nhealthcare, which is personalized medicine.\\\\nWhen discussing biomedicine, biomedical data play an\\\\nimportant role which cannot be neglected. It is vital to\\\\nextract the required knowledge from biomedical data that\\\\nwould make paths visible to explore the subject matters\\\\nfurther. When giving concern towards bioinformatics and\\\\nbiomedical data, there are various documents that contain\\\\nhigh-dimensional data with large number of attributes such\\\\nas categorical images and text records. To extract infor-\\\\nmation from such documents eÔ¨Éciently and with high ac-\\\\ncuracy,\\\\nt-distributed\\\\nstochastic\\\\nneighbour\\\\nembedding\\\\nmethod could be used. It is a popular method for exploring\\\\nhigh-dimensional data in the Ô¨Åeld of machine learning and\\\\ncan be incorporated with the multiple kernel approach as\\\\nwell. ADCMK performs data preprocessing, optimal com-\\\\nbined kernel determination, cluster centroid detection, and\\\\nassignment and visualization of clusters which shows ex-\\\\ncellent results when working with larger-scale biological and\\\\nbiomedical datasets without class label information [46].\\\\nUnder biomedical event extraction, the challenges that\\\\nprotein classiÔ¨Åcation tasks need to face due to the limited\\\\ndata that are available for learning and the unbalanced\\\\nclasses in those existing data need to be considered and\\\\naddressed. Expectation-maximization-based algorithms are\\\\nthere to address these challenges by incorporating unlabelled\\\\ndata. Even by using the n-gram model for the feature space\\\\nwith the NB classiÔ¨Åer, the accuracy of the model could be\\\\nimproved to some extent without using unlabelled data. Te\\\\ntransductive support vector machine (TSVM) method is a\\\\nsemisupervised learning approach that also could be used in\\\\naddressing the said issues. But there are other semi-\\\\nsupervised algorithms as well that could perform better in\\\\ncertain classiÔ¨Åcation problems [41].\\\\nWhile coming towards the machine learning ap-\\\\nproaches to polypharmacology, it is important to rec-\\\\nognize about certain risks or loopholes which can be\\\\nfound when integrating machine learning algorithms\\\\nwith biology and biomedicine. In some occasions, there\\\\nmay be identical twins with the same observable demo-\\\\ngraphic characteristics, lifestyle, medical care, and ge-\\\\nnetics which will provide same predictions by a machine\\\\nlearning algorithm but will end up in totally unexpected\\\\ndiÔ¨Äerent outcomes. Tis is an instance to show that the\\\\nincorporation of machine learning with biology and\\\\nbiomedicine should be performed with maximum care\\\\nand monitoring. Research studies are growing in number\\\\ntrying to increase the accuracy of the predictions made,\\\\nbut still these algorithms do not state how to change the\\\\nobtained outcome. It even does not assure whether it is\\\\npossible to change the received outcomes in any possible\\\\nway. Machine learning-based identiÔ¨Åcations are strong,\\\\nbut they are theory free. Tis means that no theory-based\\\\nexplanations can be provided, even for the generated\\\\npredictions. Sometimes, the most accurate predictions\\\\nmade by machine learning algorithms are obvious to the\\\\npracticing clinicians as well. Even though predictive al-\\\\ngorithms cannot eliminate medical uncertainty, they\\\\nimprove allocation of scarce healthcare resources. Using\\\\nDNN, now early warning systems can be rapidly devel-\\\\noped and optimized using real-world data. Tese systems\\\\nwill also have capabilities which seemed to be impossible\\\\nto be achieved previously [44].\\\\nHere onwards the discussion will give concern towards\\\\nincreasing the productivity of applications through in-\\\\ncreasing the performance of the machine learning algo-\\\\nrithms. In order to increase the performance and the\\\\neÔ¨Éciency of machine learning algorithms, various steps and\\\\nmeasures are being carried out and tested by the researchers.\\\\nWhen observing the said fact, next are a few instances to get\\\\nan idea of what sort of tasks are being conducted to increase\\\\nthe performance of the algorithms. When considering the\\\\naccuracy, sensitivity, and the speciÔ¨Åcity of classiÔ¨Åers while\\\\nchanging the number of folds, any major Ô¨Çuctuation was not\\\\nfound in the values obtained in the confusion matrix. All\\\\nwere just small variations in the Ô¨Ånal decimal places which\\\\ncan be ignored [26]. But DNN, feature selection methods,\\\\nand cross validation techniques can be applied to increase\\\\nthe classiÔ¨Åcation accuracy [10, 58]. It is also to be noted that\\\\npositive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value\\\\n(NPV), accuracy, sensitivity, and speciÔ¨Åcity attributes show\\\\nan improvement when a classiÔ¨Åer is applied after performing\\\\nPCA rather than the classiÔ¨Åer being applied to the oÔ¨Écial\\\\nfeature set (OFS). But when the GA was used instead of the\\\\nPCA, all the above attributes showed a further improvement\\\\neven than what was resulted after the PCA has been applied\\\\n[29].\\\\nEnsemble learner is constructed by a collection of\\\\nindividual classiÔ¨Åers. When there is a pattern classiÔ¨Å-\\\\ncation problem, it is solved by a combination of multiple\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åer outputs. Majority voting, bagging, and boosting\\\\nare few well-known ensemble methods which can be used\\\\nto combine the outputs. Normally, this approach is more\\\\naccurate than using a single classiÔ¨Åer. In the majority\\\\nvoting method, the label to be assigned is decided based\\\\non the majority of the individual classiÔ¨Åer‚Äôs outputs. Te\\\\nbagging method decreases the variance of the predictions\\\\nby generating additional data for training from the\\\\noriginal dataset. Te boosting method has two steps. Te\\\\nÔ¨Årst is using the original data to produce a series of\\\\naveragely performing models. Ten, the next step is to\\\\nincrease the performance by combining the previous\\\\nperformances using a voting scheme [10]. Using the\\\\nensemble technique, a weak classiÔ¨Åer can be converted to\\\\na strong classiÔ¨Åer. When working with a weak classiÔ¨Åer, it\\\\nis merged using the weighted average of the prediction\\\\naccuracy as metrics. Ten, the error will be propagated\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\n15\\\\nwith every prediction, and until the prediction becomes\\\\naccurate, multiple iterations will be carried out to reduce\\\\nthe error [59].\\\\nMaximum sensitivity neural networks use the back-\\\\npropagation algorithm to adjust the weights associated\\\\nwith the neurons. Tis is special as it saves time and\\\\nmemory while predicting more accurately as the output\\\\nlayer detects the maximum sensitivity of the neurons for\\\\nthe new pattern [47].\\\\nMachine learning feature extraction is the process that\\\\nhelps in identifying the relevant attributes from various\\\\ncandidate subnets, and it plays a vital role in creating an\\\\neÔ¨Äective predictive model. Tere are various beneÔ¨Åts of\\\\napplying feature selection, such as highly eÔ¨Äective and fast\\\\ntraining of the machine learning algorithm, reducing the\\\\ncomplexity of the model, improving the accuracy of the\\\\nmodel, and eliminating the overÔ¨Åtting problem. Tere are\\\\nthree groups that could be identiÔ¨Åed in feature selection\\\\nmethods. Tey are Ô¨Ålter, wrapper, and embedded methods.\\\\nTe Ô¨Ålter method is normally a preprocessing step that relies\\\\non general features. Te wrapper method uses machine\\\\nlearning in order to select the best and the most suited subset\\\\nof features. Forward feature selection, backward feature\\\\nelimination, and recursive feature elimination are widely\\\\nused wrapper methods. Te embedded method combines\\\\nthe qualities of the Ô¨Ålter and wrapper methods [17]. It is\\\\nimportant to remember that when features are correlated to\\\\nother features, there is no point having all of them con-\\\\nsidered in the machine learning algorithm as it will increase\\\\nonly the execution time but will not improve the eÔ¨Éciency of\\\\nthe algorithm. It is also to be noted that when adding certain\\\\nfeatures, the accuracy of the algorithm may drop. It is\\\\npreferred if each of the features could be tested individually\\\\nand then combined in a way that the accuracy of the output\\\\nwill be increased [27]. Te quality of the feature selection\\\\nprocess has a direct impact on the accuracy increase. Some\\\\nalgorithms like ANN show a higher increase in the accuracy\\\\nwhen compared with other algorithms after the feature\\\\nselection phase is performed [25].\\\\nMachine learning techniques have gained signiÔ¨Åcantly\\\\nhigh accuracy when considering classiÔ¨Åcation-based prob-\\\\nlems. A four-tier architecture can be used to store and\\\\nprocess a huge volume of data eÔ¨Éciently. Tier 1 can be used\\\\nto collect data, and tier 2 can be used to store huge volumes\\\\nof data. Tier 3 and tier 4 can be used for machine learning\\\\nclassiÔ¨Åcations and representation of the results, respectively\\\\n[14]. In the present time, as computing power is not an issue,\\\\nDNN has more than 20 layers. Early neural networks were\\\\ntypically less than 5 layers. DNNs are used for various\\\\npurposes such as automatic object detection, segmentation\\\\non images, automatic speech recognition, genotypic and\\\\nphenotypic detection, classiÔ¨Åcation of diseases in bio-\\\\ninformatics, and so on. Even though CNN is quite similar to\\\\nregular neural networks, it assumes that there are geometric\\\\nrelationships among inputs. By using convolutional layers in\\\\nDNN, important features could be ampliÔ¨Åed for better\\\\nanalysis. Te pooling layer in CNN takes the output and\\\\nÔ¨Ånds the maximal value so that it could give the convolution\\\\nfunction the best extracts of the images. Regularization is\\\\nused when training deep networks as it increases the per-\\\\nformance by reducing overÔ¨Åtting. Tere are no exact number\\\\nof layers to obtain more accurate results, but it is an iterative\\\\ntrial and error process in which the best architecture needs to\\\\nbe found for a speciÔ¨Åc problem. Te advantage of using CNN\\\\nover traditional machine learning algorithms is that there is\\\\nno need to compute the features as the Ô¨Årst step. But CNN\\\\nwill Ô¨Ånd the important features as a part of its searching\\\\nprocess [8].\\\\nAs ANN is complex, other simple machine learning\\\\nalgorithms such as SVM, KNN, and RF gradually came\\\\nahead of ANN in popularity. By selecting the appropriate\\\\nactivation functions, better feature extraction can be\\\\nachieved, as they are what form the nonlinear layers in deep\\\\nlearning frameworks. Tere are many activation functions.\\\\nSigmoid function, hyperbolic tangent, softmax, rectiÔ¨Åed\\\\nlinear unit (ReLU), softplus, absolute value rectiÔ¨Åcation, and\\\\nmaxout are a few of such commonly used activation\\\\nfunctions. Tere are various deep learning architectures such\\\\nas AE, DBN, restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM), CNN,\\\\nand RNN. AE is diÔ¨Äerent from ordinary ANN as it extracts\\\\nfeatures from unlabelled data and sets target values to be\\\\nequal to the inputs. RBMs are generative graphical models\\\\nand their aim is to learn the distribution of the training data.\\\\nDBM can be considered as a stack of AEs or RBMs. CNN is\\\\ndiÔ¨Äerent from other deep learning algorithms as it extracts\\\\nfeatures from small sections of an input image. RNN out-\\\\nperforms all the other deep learning approaches when it is\\\\nabout dealing with sequential data. Machine learning is\\\\nwidely used in the medical image domain. Sparse autoen-\\\\ncoder (SAE) and RBM can deal with dynamic data and they\\\\ncan also extract patterns from unlabelled data. Due to its\\\\ncapacity of analysing special data, CNN is used in biomedical\\\\nimage analysis commonly. When considering the challenges,\\\\nit is to note that in deep learning, it requires a large amount\\\\nof labelled data for model training. Another issue when\\\\nworking with biomedical data is that they are imbalanced, as\\\\nthe normal people set is much larger than the diagnosed\\\\npeople set. Tey also need high memory and high computing\\\\npower. Te input images must be in high resolution.\\\\nNowadays, there are various medical devices and sensors\\\\nwhich provide large amounts of data. Deep learning ap-\\\\nproaches are good interpreters of these data for disease\\\\nprediction, prevention, and diagnosis. Table 1 lists few ap-\\\\nplications of the above-discussed deep learning algorithms\\\\nin the Ô¨Åeld of biology and biomedicine [60].\\\\nAs per Table 2, there are several open-source machine\\\\nlearning libraries in various languages which could be used\\\\nto assist in the development process when implementing\\\\nintelligent biological applications. Python and C++ have the\\\\nmost number of libraries that support deep learning. But\\\\nPython is more often used in traditional machine learning\\\\napproaches [60]. Te popularity or the usage of various deep\\\\nlearning frameworks in projects, when categorized based on\\\\nthe language that they are written in, is shown in Figure 1.\\\\nAt the initial stage, simple machine learning classifying\\\\nand clustering algorithms were used in data processing and\\\\npredictions, but when moving forward, with the develop-\\\\nment\\\\nin\\\\ncomputational\\\\npower\\\\nand\\\\nprogramming\\\\n16\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\nmethodologies, more enhanced and complex machine\\\\nlearning algorithms were adapted by the Ô¨Åeld of biology and\\\\nbiomedicine to obtain more accurate results at a higher\\\\neÔ¨Éciency. Even at this very moment various attempts are\\\\nbeing executed to further evolve the computational biology\\\\nand biomedicine domain with the integration of sophisti-\\\\ncated scalable machine learning algorithms. Many languages\\\\nprovide multiple application program interfaces (APIs) and\\\\nlibraries in order to assist in these development processes so\\\\nthat the main concern or priority could be given to the\\\\nrequirement with regard to the subject matter and less at-\\\\ntention towards the eÔ¨Éciency and performance of the al-\\\\ngorithms, as they have already been handled by the libraries\\\\nor APIs. Tese algorithms could even be applied to diÔ¨Äerent\\\\ndomains such as marketing, social media, search engines,\\\\nfraud detection, stock market analysis, e-business, authen-\\\\ntication, and so on by changing the training datasets and the\\\\nfeatures to be analysed. But in this review paper, the\\\\ncomputational\\\\nbiology\\\\nand\\\\nbiomedicine\\\\ndomain\\\\nwas\\\\nconsidered.\\\\nWhen coming back to precision medicine, as discussed\\\\npreviously, the simplest deÔ¨Ånition that could be provided\\\\nwould be treating patients based on their genetic, lifestyle,\\\\nand environmental data. Tis is simply not an easy task. It\\\\nneeds to have a whole load of data that should be analysed to\\\\nobtain the required knowledge for it. Tis is near impossible\\\\nfor humans to manually process. Furthermore, some rela-\\\\ntionships among data cannot be identiÔ¨Åed by humans after\\\\nexploring the dataset. But as discussed previously, unsu-\\\\npervised machine learning has been able to capture these\\\\nrelationships and group data according to the identiÔ¨Åed\\\\nrelationships. As precision medicine studies are involved\\\\nwith genes, it is certain that the biomedical event extraction\\\\nwould also contribute towards it. For a patient to then be\\\\ntreated using precision medicine, few approaches in com-\\\\nputational biology are vital, such as biomedical data analysis,\\\\ndisease diagnosis, and medical image analysis. Te reason is\\\\nthat categorizing the patients to identify the treatment to be\\\\nfollowed according to a set of considered factors needs better\\\\nobservations of the patient and his/her medical history.\\\\nTable 1: Applications of deep learning algorithms in computational biology [60].\\\\nDeep learning\\\\nalgorithm\\\\nMedical image analysis\\\\nProtein structure prediction\\\\nGenomic sequencing and gene\\\\nexpression analysis\\\\nConvolutional\\\\nneural network\\\\nBrain tumour segmentation, knee\\\\ncartilage segmentation, prediction of\\\\nsemantic descriptions from medical\\\\nimages, segmentation of MR brain\\\\nimages, coronary artery calcium scoring\\\\nin CT images\\\\nPrediction of protein order/\\\\ndisorder regions, prediction of\\\\nprotein secondary structures,\\\\nprediction of protein structure\\\\nproperties\\\\n‚Äî\\\\nSparse\\\\nautoencoder\\\\nOrgan detection in 4D patient data,\\\\nsegmentation of hippocampus from\\\\ninfant brains, histological\\\\ncharacterization of healthy skin and\\\\nhealing wounds\\\\nSequence-based prediction of\\\\nbackbone CŒ± angles and dihedrals\\\\n‚Äî\\\\nDeep belief\\\\nnetwork\\\\nSegmentation of left ventricle of the heart\\\\nfrom MR data, discrimination of retinal-\\\\nbased diseases\\\\nPrediction of protein disorder,\\\\nprediction of secondary structures,\\\\nlocal backbone angles\\\\nModelling structural binding\\\\npreferences and predicting binding\\\\nsites of RNA-binding proteins,\\\\nprediction of splice junction at DNA\\\\nlevel\\\\nDeep neural\\\\nnetwork\\\\nBrain tumour segmentation in MR\\\\nimages, prostate MR segmentation, gland\\\\ninstance segmentation\\\\n‚Äî\\\\nGene expression inference,\\\\nprediction of enhancer, prediction of\\\\nsplicing patterns in individual tissues\\\\nand diÔ¨Äerences in splicing patterns\\\\nacross tissues\\\\nRecurrent neural\\\\nnetwork\\\\nClassiÔ¨Åcation of patterns of EEG\\\\nsynchronization for seizure prediction,\\\\nEEG-based lapse detection\\\\nPrediction of protein secondary\\\\nstructure, prediction of protein\\\\ncontact map\\\\nPrediction of miRNA precursor and\\\\nmiRNA targets, detection of splice\\\\njunctions from DNA sequences\\\\nTable 2: Machine learning libraries in languages [8].\\\\nLanguage\\\\nTraditional machine learning libraries\\\\nDeep neural network machine learning libraries\\\\nPython\\\\nScikit-learn, PyBrain, Nilearn, Pattern, MILK,\\\\nMixtend\\\\nKeras, TensorÔ¨Çow (written in both C++ and Python), Nolearn, DeePy,\\\\nPylearn2\\\\nR\\\\nCaret, Boruta, GMMBoost, H2O, KlaR,\\\\nrminer\\\\nDarch, DeepNet\\\\nC++\\\\nShogun\\\\nCaÔ¨Äe, EBLearn, Intel Deep learning Framework, TensorÔ¨Çow (written in both\\\\nC++ and Python)\\\\nJava\\\\nEncog, Spark, Mahout, MALLET, Weka\\\\nDeeplearning4j\\\\nJavaScript\\\\nCluster, LDA, Node-SVM\\\\nConvnetJS\\\\nJournal of Healthcare Engineering\\\\n17\\\\nTroughout this paper, on many occasions, the in-\\\\nvolvement of machine learning in computational biology\\\\nand biomedicine has been discussed. Te reason behind it is\\\\nthat more than 80% of the healthcare decisions are made\\\\nbased on the said areas. In addition to it, data analytics is\\\\nbeing applied in the healthcare sector to improve the\\\\nhealthcare services by predicting the future expectations\\\\nbased on a patient\\'s medical history. Terefore, there is no\\\\ndoubt that prominent attention needs to be given towards\\\\nthe areas of computational biology and biomedicine when\\\\ndiscussing computational decision making in healthcare. But\\\\nit is to be highlighted that whenever we use an approach\\\\nrelated to artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence in healthcare, it is always\\\\nrelated to making a decision. Disease detection, disease\\\\nprediction, drug repurposing, precision medicine, medical\\\\nresource allocation, and much more can be shown as evi-\\\\ndence for it. In all of them, a machine learning algorithm\\\\neither makes a decision or least it would support a decision.\\\\nIt helps in solving a doubt that a clinician may have or\\\\nsometimes highlighting a fact which was not visible to the\\\\nclinician at the time of making a decision as a solution for a\\\\nhealthcare-related issue. In addition to it, most importantly,\\\\nit deals with people‚Äôs lives and even a simple mistake can\\\\nmake a huge impact on a person and even the society at\\\\nlarge. Terefore, computational decision making is so crucial\\\\nin the healthcare sector to make conÔ¨Ådent and accurate\\\\ndecisions in less time and at low cost. Tis has only been\\\\npossible with machine learning approaches being adapted as\\\\na tool in healthcare and is currently being extensively applied\\\\nin healthcare decisions.\\\\n10. Conclusion\\\\nWhile reaching the end of the paper, there is no doubt that\\\\nmachine learning algorithms, which is a subsection of ar-\\\\ntiÔ¨Åcial intelligence, have inspired the Ô¨Åeld of computational\\\\nbiology and have contributed immensely to the healthcare\\\\nsector in terms of fast, eÔ¨Écient, accurate, and cost-eÔ¨Äective\\\\ncomputational decision making. It is clearly visible that in\\\\nthe present context, machine learning has been applied in\\\\nvarious sections in the discussed Ô¨Åeld. Te involvement of\\\\nmachine learning can be found in disease diagnosis and\\\\nprediction, medical imaging, drug repurposing, biomedical\\\\nevent extraction, and much more in healthcare. But what is\\\\ncertain is that the journey that started with the integration of\\\\nmachine learning to computational biology has come a long\\\\nway passing several milestones and is now at a peak with the\\\\nintroduction of precision medicine. When considering all\\\\nthe above applications of machine learning in healthcare,\\\\nwhat is clearly visible is that how artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence has\\\\nbeen a key resource area for decision making in the\\\\nhealthcare sector in various aspects. When giving concern to\\\\nthe most recent applications of artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence in\\\\nhealthcare, the best example would be how diÔ¨Äerent tasks\\\\nsuch as patient care, treatment research, resource allocations\\\\nbased on the hospital volume, predictions and preparing for\\\\nfuture possible requirement, and so on were handled and\\\\nmanaged during the COVID-19 pandemic. With all that\\\\nbeing said, it is crystal clear that artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence had\\\\nplayed a huge role through machine learning to implement\\\\ncomputational decision making tools for the healthcare\\\\nsector, and in present times, they are of much importance\\\\nand could not be separated from the healthcare sector.\\\\nConflicts of Interest\\\\nTe authors declare that they have no conÔ¨Çicts of interest.\\\\nAcknowledgments\\\\nTe authors would like to specially thank the respective staÔ¨Ä\\\\nmembers in the Faculty of Information Technology of\\\\nUniversity of Moratuwa who guided and assisted them to\\\\nwrite this paper.\\\\nReferences\\\\n[1] S.

Data mining techniques \\\\ncan create a shift from conventional medical databases to a \\\\nknowledge-rich, evidence-based healthcare environment in \\\\nthe coming decade.\\\\nBig data and its utility in healthcare and medical sciences \\\\nhave become more critical with the dawn of the social media \\\\nera (platforms such as Facebook and Twitter) and smart-\\\\nphone apps that can monitor personal health parameters \\\\nusing sensors and analyzers [6, 7]. The role of data mining is \\\\nto improvise the stored user information to provide superior \\\\ntreatment and care. This review article provides an insight \\\\ninto the advantages and methodologies of big data usage \\\\nin health care systems. It highlights the voluminous data \\\\ngenerated in these systems, their qualities, possible security-\\\\nrelated problems, data handling, and how this analytics sup-\\\\nport gaining significant insight into these data set.\\\\nSearch strategy\\\\nA non-systematic review of all data science, big data in \\\\nhealthcare-related English language literature published in \\\\nthe last decade (2010‚Äì2020) was conducted in November \\\\n2020 using MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, and Google \\\\nScholar. Our search strategy involved creating a search \\\\nstring based on a combination of keywords.

The evaluation of titles and abstracts, \\\\nscreening, and the full article text was conducted for the \\\\nchosen articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Further-\\\\nmore, the authors manually reviewed the selected article‚Äôs \\\\nreferences list to screen for any additional work of interest. \\\\nThe authors resolved the disagreements about eligibility for \\\\na consensus decision after discussion.\\\\nKnowing more about\\xa0‚Äúbig data‚Äù\\\\nBig data consists of vast volumes of data, which cannot \\\\nbe managed using conventional technologies. Although \\\\nthere are many ways to define big data, we can consider \\\\nthe one defined by Douglas Laney [8] that represents three \\\\ndimensions, namely, volume, velocity, and variety (3 Vs). \\\\nThe ‚Äúbig‚Äù in big data implies its large volume. Velocity \\\\ndemonstrates the speed or rate at which data is processed. \\\\nVariety focuses on the various forms of structured and raw \\\\ndata obtained by any method or device, such as transaction-\\\\nlevel data, videos, audios, texts, emails, and logs. The 3 Vs \\\\nbecame the default description of big data, while many other \\\\nVs are added to the definition [9]. ‚ÄúVeracity‚Äù remains the \\\\nmost agreed 4th ‚ÄúV.‚Äù Data veracity focuses on the accuracy \\\\nand reliability of a dataset. It helps to filter through what is \\\\nimportant and what is not. The data with high veracity has \\\\nmany records that are valuable to analyze and that contribute \\\\nin a meaningful way to the overall results. This aspect poses \\\\nthe biggest challenge when it comes to big data. With so \\\\nmuch data available, ensuring that it is relevant and of high \\\\nquality is important. Over recent years, big data has become \\\\nincreasingly popular across all parts of the globe.\\\\nBig data needs technologically sophisticated applications \\\\nthat use high-end computing resources and Artificial Intel-\\\\nligence (AI)-based algorithms to understand such huge vol-\\\\numes of data. Machine learning (ML) approaches for auto-\\\\nmatic decision-making by applying fuzzy logic and neural \\\\nnetworks will be added advantage. Innovative and efficient \\\\nstrategies for dealing with data, smart cloud-based applica-\\\\ntions, effective storage, and user-friendly visualization are \\\\nrequired for big data to gain practical insights [10].\\\\nMedical care as\\xa0a\\xa0repository for\\xa0big data\\\\nHealthcare is a multilayered system developed specifically \\\\nfor preventing, diagnosing, and treating diseases. The key \\\\nelements of medical care are health practitioners (physicians \\\\nand nurses), healthcare facilities (which include clinics, drug \\\\ndelivery centers, and other testing or treatment technolo-\\\\ngies), and a funding agency that funds the former. Health \\\\ncare practitioners belong to different fields of health such as \\\\ndentistry, pharmacy, medicine, nursing, psychology, allied \\\\nhealth sciences, and many more. Depending on the sever-\\\\nity of the cases, health care is provided at many levels. In \\\\n1474\\\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\\\n1 3\\\\nall these stages, health practitioners need different forms of \\\\ninformation such as the medical history of the patient (data \\\\nrelated to medication and prescriptions), clinical data (such \\\\nas data from laboratory assessments), and other personal or \\\\nprivate medical data. The usual practice for a clinic, hospi-\\\\ntal, or patient to retain these medical documents would be \\\\nmaintaining either written notes or in the form of printed \\\\nreports [11].\\\\nThe clinical case records preserve the incidence and out-\\\\ncome of disease in a person‚Äôs body as a tale in the family, \\\\nand the doctor plays an integral role in this tale [12]. With \\\\nthe emergence of electronic systems and their capacity, digi-\\\\ntizing medical exams, health records, and investigations is \\\\na common procedure today. In 2003, the Institute of Medi-\\\\ncine, a division in the National Academies of Sciences and \\\\nEngineering coined the term ‚ÄúElectronic Health Records‚Äù \\\\nfor representing an electronic portal that saves the records of \\\\nthe patients. Electronic health records (EHRs) are automated \\\\nmedical records of patients related to an individual‚Äôs physi-\\\\ncal/mental health or significant reports that are saved in an \\\\nelectronic system and used to record, send, receive, store, \\\\nretrieve, and connect the medical personnel and patient with \\\\nmedical services [13].\\\\nOpen‚Äësource big data platforms\\\\nIt is an inefficient idea to work with big data or vast vol-\\\\numes of data into storage considering even the most power-\\\\nful computers. Hence, the only logical approach to process \\\\nlarge quantities of big data available in a complex form is \\\\nby spreading and processing it on several parallel connected \\\\nnodes. Nevertheless, the volume of the data is typically so \\\\nhigh that a large number of computing machines are needed \\\\nin a reasonable period to distribute and finish processing. \\\\nWorking with thousands of nodes involves coping with \\\\nissues related to paralleling the computation, spreading \\\\nof data, and manage failures. Table\\xa01 shows the few open \\\\nsources of big data platforms and their utilities for data \\\\nscientists.\\\\nData mining\\\\nData types can be classified based on their nature, source, \\\\nand data collection methods [14]. Data mining techniques \\\\ninclude data grouping, data clustering, data correlation, and \\\\nmining of sequential patterns, regression, and data storage. \\\\nThere are several sources to obtain healthcare-related data \\\\n(Fig.\\xa01). The most commonly used type (77%) is the data \\\\nTable\\u202f1\\u2002 \\u2009Open  source big data platforms and their utilities\\\\nBig data tools\\\\nUtilities\\\\nApache Hadoop\\\\nIt is designed to scale up to thousands of machines from single servers, each of which offers local storage\\\\nThe framework enables users to easily build and validate distributed structures, distributes data, and operates across \\\\nmachines automatically\\\\nApache Spark\\\\nThe Hadoop Distributed File system (HDFS) and other data stores are flexible to work with\\\\nSpark offers integrated Application Program Interfaces (APIs) which enable users to write apps in different languages\\\\nApache Cassandra\\\\nCassandra is highly flexible and can add additional hardware that can handle more data and users on demand\\\\nCassandra adapts to all possible data types such as unstructured, structured, and semi-structured supporting features such as \\\\nAtomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID)\\\\nApache Storm\\\\nIn several cases, Apache Storm is easy to integrate with any programming language, with real-time analytics, online \\\\nmachine learning, and computation\\\\nApache Storm uses parallel calculations which run across a machine cluster\\\\nRapidMiner\\\\nRapidMiner provides a variety of products for a new process of data mining\\\\nIt provides an integrated data preparation environment, machine learning, text mining, visualization, predictive analysis, \\\\napplication development, prototype validation, and implementation. statistic modeling, deployment\\\\nCloudera\\\\nUsers can spin clusters, terminate them, and only pay for what they need\\\\nCloudera Enterprise can be deployed and run on AWS and Google Cloud Platforms by users\\\\nFig.\\u202f1\\u2002 \\u2009Sources of big data in healthcare\\\\n1475\\\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\\\n1 3\\\\ngenerated by humans (HG data) which includes Electronic \\\\nMedical Records (EMR), Electronic Health Records (EHR), \\\\nand Electronic Patient Records (EPR). Online data through \\\\nWeb Service (WS) is considered as the second largest form \\\\nof data (11%) due to the increase in the number of people \\\\nusing social media day by day and current digital develop-\\\\nment in the medical sector [15]. Recent advances in the \\\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)-based methodologies \\\\nare also making WS simpler to use [16]. The other data \\\\nforms such as Sensor Data (SD), Big Transactional Data \\\\n(BTD), and Biometric Data (BM) make around 12% of \\\\noverall data use, but wearable personal health monitoring \\\\ndevices‚Äô prominence and market growth [17] may need SD \\\\nand BM data.\\\\nApplications of\\xa0analytics in\\xa0healthcare\\\\nThere are six areas of applications of analytics in healthcare \\\\n(Fig.\\xa02) including disease surveillance, health care manage-\\\\nment and administration, privacy protection and fraud detec-\\\\ntion, mental health, public health, and pharmacovigilance. \\\\nResearchers have implemented data extraction for data \\\\ndeposition and cloud-based computing, optimizing quality, \\\\nlowering costs, leveraging resources, handling patients, and \\\\nother fields.\\\\nDisease surveillance\\\\nIt involves the perception of the disease, understanding its \\\\ncondition, etiology (the manner of causation of a disease), \\\\nand prevention (Fig.\\xa03).\\\\nInformation obtained with the help of EHRs, and the \\\\nInternet has a huge prospect for disease analysis. The various \\\\nsurveillance methods would aid the planning of services, \\\\nevaluation of treatments, priority setting, and the develop-\\\\nment of health policy and practice.\\\\nImage processing of\\xa0healthcare data \\\\nfrom\\xa0the\\xa0big data point of\\xa0view\\\\nImage processing on healthcare data offers valuable knowl-\\\\nedge about anatomy and organ functioning and identifies \\\\nthe disease and patient health conditions. The technique \\\\ncurrently has been used for organ delineation, identification \\\\nof lung tumors, diagnosis of spinal deformity, detection of \\\\narterial stenosis, detection of an aneurysm, etc. [18]. The \\\\nwavelets technique is commonly used for image process-\\\\ning techniques such as segmentation, enhancement, and \\\\nnoise reduction. The use of artificial intelligence in image \\\\nprocessing will enhance aspects of health care including \\\\nscreening, diagnosis, and prognosis, and integrating medi-\\\\ncal images with other types of data and genomic data will \\\\nincrease accuracy and facilitate early diagnosis of diseases \\\\n[18, 19]. The exponential increase in the count of medical \\\\nfacilities and patients has led to better use of clinical set-\\\\ntings of computer-based healthcare diagnostics and decision-\\\\nmaking systems.\\\\nData from\\xa0wearable technology\\\\nMulti-National Companies like Apple and Google are \\\\nworking on health-based apps and wearable technology as \\\\npart of a broader range of electronic sensors, the so-called \\\\nFig.\\u202f2\\u2002 \\u2009Various applications of data science in healthcare\\\\nFig.\\u202f3\\u2002 \\u2009The disease analysis system\\\\n1476\\\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\\\n1 3\\\\nIoT, and toolkits for healthcare-related apps. The pos-\\\\nsibility of collecting accurate medical data on real-time \\\\n(e.g., mood, diet followed, exercise, and sleep cycles pat-\\\\nterns), linked to physiological indicators (e.g., heart rate, \\\\ncalories burned, level of blood glucose, cortisol levels), is \\\\nperhaps discrete and omnipresent at minimum cost, unre-\\\\nlated to traditional health care. ‚ÄúTrue Colors‚Äù is a wear-\\\\nable designed to collect continuous patient-centric data \\\\nwith the accessibility and acceptability needed to allow \\\\nfor accurate longitudinal follow-up. More importantly, \\\\nthis system is presently being piloted as a daily health-\\\\nmonitoring substitute.\\\\nMedical signal analytics\\\\nTelemetry and the devices for the monitoring of physi-\\\\nological parameters generate large amounts of data. The \\\\ndata generated generally are retained for a shorter dura-\\\\ntion, and thus, extensive research into produced data is \\\\nneglected. However, advancements in data science in the \\\\nfield of healthcare attempt to ensure better management of \\\\ndata and provide enhanced patient care [20‚Äì23].\\\\nThe use of continuous waveform in health records con-\\\\ntaining information generated through the application of \\\\nstatistical disciplines (e.g., statistical, quantitative, con-\\\\ntextual, cognitive, predictive, etc.) can drive comprehen-\\\\nsive care decision-making. Data acquisition apart from an \\\\ningestion-streaming platform is needed that can control a \\\\nset of waveforms at various fidelity rates. The integration \\\\nof this waveform data with the EHR‚Äôs static data results in \\\\nan important component for giving analytics engine situ-\\\\national as well as contextual awareness. Enhancing the \\\\ndata collected by analytics will not just make the method \\\\nmore reliable, but will also help in balancing predictive \\\\nanalytics‚Äô sensitivity and specificity. The signal processing \\\\nspecies must mainly rely on the kind of disease population \\\\nunder observation.\\\\nVarious signal-processing techniques can be used to \\\\nderive a large number of target properties that are later \\\\nconsumed to provide actionable insight by a pre-trained \\\\nmachine-learning model. Such observations may be ana-\\\\nlytical, prescriptive, or predictive. Such insights can be \\\\nfurthermore built to activate other techniques such as \\\\nalarms and physician notifications. Maintaining these con-\\\\ntinuous waveforms‚Äìbased data along with specific data \\\\nobtained from the remaining sources in perfect harmony \\\\nto find the appropriate patient information to improve \\\\ndiagnosis and treatments of the next generation can be \\\\na daunting task [24]. Several technological criteria and \\\\nspecifications at the framework, analytical, and clinical \\\\nlevels need to be planned and implemented for the bedside \\\\nimplementation of these systems into medical setups.\\\\nHealthcare administration\\\\nKnowledge obtained from big data analysis gives health-\\\\ncare providers insights not available otherwise (Fig.\\xa04). \\\\nResearchers have implemented data mining techniques to \\\\ndata warehousing as well as cloud computing, increasing \\\\nquality, minimizing costs, handling patients, and several \\\\nother fields of healthcare.\\\\nData storage and\\xa0cloud computing\\\\nData warehousing and cloud storage are primarily used for \\\\nstoring the increasing amount of electronic patient-centric \\\\ndata [25, 26] safely and cost-effectively to enhance medical \\\\noutcomes. Besides medical purposes, data storage is utilized \\\\nfor purposes of research, training, education, and quality \\\\ncontrol. Users can also extract files from a repository con-\\\\ntaining the radiology results by using keywords following \\\\nthe predefined patient privacy policy.\\\\nCost and\\xa0quality of\\xa0healthcare and\\xa0utilization \\\\nof\\xa0resources\\\\nThe migration of imaging reports to electronic medical \\\\nrecording systems offers tremendous potential for advancing \\\\nresearch and practice on radiology through the continuous \\\\nupdating, incorporation, and exchange of a large volume of \\\\ndata. However, the heterogeneity in how these data can be \\\\nformatted still poses major challenges. The overall objec-\\\\ntive of NLP is that the natural human language is translated \\\\ninto structured with a standardized set of value choices that \\\\nare easily manipulated into subsections or searches for the \\\\npresence or absence of a finding through software, among \\\\nother things [27].\\\\nGreaves et\\xa0al. [28] analyzed sentiment (computationally \\\\ndividing them into categories such as optimistic, pessimis-\\\\ntic, and neutral) based on the online response of patients \\\\nFig.\\u202f4\\u2002 \\u2009Role of big data in accelerating the treatment process\\\\n1477\\\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\\\n1 3\\\\nstating their overall experience to predict healthcare qual-\\\\nity. They found an agreement above 80% between online \\\\nplatform sentiment analysis and conventional paper-based \\\\nquality prediction surveys (e.g., cleanliness, positive con-\\\\nduct, recommendation). The newer solution can be a cost-\\\\neffective alternative to conventional healthcare surveys and \\\\nstudies. The physician‚Äôs overuse of screening and testing \\\\noften leads to surplus data and excess costs [29]. The present \\\\npractice in pathology is restricted by the emphasis on illness. \\\\nZhuang et\\xa0al. [29] compared the disease-based approach in \\\\nconjunction with database reasoning and used the data min-\\\\ning technique to build a decision support system based on \\\\nevidence to minimize the unnecessary testing to reduce the \\\\ntotal expense of patient care.\\\\nPatient data management\\\\nPatient data management involves effective scheduling and \\\\nthe delivery of patient care during the period of a patient‚Äôs \\\\nstay in a hospital. The framework of patient-centric health-\\\\ncare is shown in Fig.\\xa05. Daggy et\\xa0al. [30] conducted a study \\\\non ‚Äúno shows‚Äù or missing appointments that lead to the clini-\\\\ncal capability that has been underused. A logistical regres-\\\\nsion model is developed using electronic medical records to \\\\nestimate the probabilities of patients to no-show and show \\\\nthe use of estimates for creating clinical schedules that opti-\\\\nmize clinical capacity use while retaining limited waiting \\\\ntimes and clinical extra-time. The 400-day clinical call-in \\\\nprocess was simulated, and two timetables were developed \\\\nper day: the conventional method, which assigns one patient \\\\nper appointment slot, and the proposed method, which \\\\nschedules patients to balance patient waiting time, additional \\\\ntime, and income according to no-show likelihood.\\\\nIf patient no-show models are mixed with advanced pro-\\\\ngramming approaches, more patients can be seen a day thus \\\\nenhancing clinical performance. The advantages of imple-\\\\nmentation of planning software, including certain method-\\\\nologies, should be considered by clinics as regards no-show \\\\ncosts [30].\\\\nA study conducted by Cubillas et\\xa0al. [31] pointed out \\\\nthat it takes less time for patients who came for adminis-\\\\ntrative purposes than for patients for health reasons. They \\\\nalso developed a statistical design for estimating the num-\\\\nber of administrative visits. With a time saving of 21.73% \\\\n(660,538\\xa0min), their model enhanced the scheduling sys-\\\\ntem. Unlike administrative data/target finding patients, a few \\\\ncome very regularly for their medical treatment and cover a \\\\nsignificant amount of medical workload. Koskela et\\xa0al. [32] \\\\nused both supervised and unsupervised learning strategies \\\\nto identify and cluster records; the supervised strategy per-\\\\nformed well in one cluster with 86% accuracy in distinguish-\\\\ning fare documents from the incorrect ones, whereas the \\\\nunsupervised technique failed. This approach can be applied \\\\nto the semi-automate EMR entry system [32].\\\\nPrivacy of\\xa0medical data and\\xa0fraudulency \\\\ndetection\\\\nThe anonymization of patient data, maintaining the privacy \\\\nof the medical data and fraudulency detection in health-\\\\ncare, is crucial. This demands efforts from data scientists \\\\nto protect the big data from hackers. Mohammed et\\xa0al. [33] \\\\nintroduced a unique anonymization algorithm that works \\\\nfor both distributed and centralized anonymization and dis-\\\\ncussed the problems of privacy security. For maintaining \\\\ndata usefulness without the loss of any data privacy, the \\\\nresearchers further proposed a model that performed far bet-\\\\nter than the traditional K-anonymization model. In addition \\\\nto this, their algorithm could also deal with voluminous, \\\\nmulti-dimensional datasets.\\\\nA mobile-based cloud-computing framework [34] of big \\\\ndata has been introduced to overcome the shortcomings of \\\\ntoday‚Äôs medical records systems. EHR data systems are \\\\nconstrained due to a lack of interoperability, size of data, \\\\nand privacy. This unique cloud-based system proposed to \\\\nstore EHR data from multiple healthcare providers within \\\\nFig.\\u202f5\\u2002 \\u2009Elemental structure of patient-centric healthcare and ecosys-\\\\ntem\\\\n1478\\\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\\\n1 3\\\\nthe facility of an internet provider to provide authorized \\\\nrestricted access to healthcare providers and patients.

Fraud detection and abuse (i.e., sus-\\\\npicious care behavior, deliberate act of falsely representing \\\\nfacts, and unwanted repeated visits) make excellent use of \\\\nbig data analytics [36].\\\\nBy using data from gynecology-based reports, Yang et\\xa0al. \\\\nframed a system that manually distinguishes characteristics \\\\nof suspicious specimens from a set of medical care plans \\\\nthat any doctor would mostly adopt [37]. The technique was \\\\nimplemented on the data from Taiwan‚Äôs Bureau of National \\\\nHealth Insurance (BNHI), where the proposed technique \\\\nmanaged to detect 69% of the total cases as fraudulent, \\\\nenhancing the current model, which detected only 63% of \\\\nfraudulent cases. To sum up, the protection of patient data \\\\nand the detection of fraud are of significant concern due \\\\nto the growing usage of social media technology and the \\\\npropensity of people to place personal information on these \\\\nplatforms. The already existing strategies for anonymizing \\\\nthe data may become less successful if they are not imple-\\\\nmented because a significant section of the personal details \\\\nof everyone is now accessible through these platforms.\\\\nMental health\\\\nAccording to National Survey conducted on Drug Use \\\\nand Health (NSDUH), 52.2% of the total population in the \\\\nUnited States (U.S.) was affected by either mental problems \\\\nor drug addiction/abuse [38]. In addition, approximately 30 \\\\nmillion suffer from panic attacks and anxiety disorders [39].\\\\nPanagiotakopoulos et\\xa0al. [40] developed a data analy-\\\\nsis‚Äìfocused treatment technique to help doctors in manag-\\\\ning patients with anxiety disorders. The authors used static \\\\ninformation that includes personal information such as the \\\\nage of the individual, sex, body and skin types, and family \\\\ndetails and dynamic information like the context of stress, \\\\nclimate, and symptoms to construct static and dynamic \\\\ninformation based on user models. For the first three ser-\\\\nvices, relationships between different complex parameters \\\\nwere established, and the remaining one was mainly used to \\\\npredict stress rates under various scenarios. This model was \\\\nverified with the help of data collected from twenty-seven \\\\nvolunteers who are selected via the anxiety assessment sur-\\\\nvey. The applications of data analytics in the disease diag-\\\\nnosis, examination, or treatment of patients with mental \\\\nwellbeing are very different from using analytics to antici-\\\\npate cancer or diabetes. In this case, the data context (static, \\\\ndynamic, or non-observable environment) seems to be more \\\\nimportant compared to data volume [39].\\\\nThe leading cause of perinatal morbidity and death is \\\\npremature birth, but an exact mechanism is still unclear. The \\\\nresearch carried by Chen et\\xa0al. [41] intended to investigate \\\\nthe risk factors of preterm use of neural networks and deci-\\\\nsion tree C5.0 data mining. The original medical data was \\\\nobtained by a specialist study group at the National Uni-\\\\nversity of Taiwan from a prospective pregnancy cohort. A \\\\ntotal of 910 mother‚Äìchild dyads from 14,551 in the original \\\\ndata have been recruited using the nest case‚Äìcontrol design. \\\\nIn this data, thousands of variables are studied, including \\\\nbasic features, medical background, the climate and parents‚Äô \\\\noccupational factors, and the variables related to children. \\\\nThe findings suggest that the main risk factors for pre-born \\\\nbirth are multiple births, blood pressure during pregnancy, \\\\nage, disease, prior preterm history, body weight and height \\\\nof pregnant women, and paternal life risks associated with \\\\ndrinking and smoking. The results of the study are there-\\\\nfore helpful in the attempt to diagnose high-risk pregnant \\\\nwomen and to provide intervention early to minimize and \\\\navoid early births in parents, healthcare workers, and public \\\\nhealth workers [41, 42].\\\\nPublic health\\\\nData analytics have also been applied to the detection of dis-\\\\nease during outbreaks. Kostkova et\\xa0al. [43] analyzed online \\\\nrecords based on behavior patterns and media reporting the \\\\nfactors that affect the public as well as professional patterns \\\\nof search-related disease outbreaks. They found distinct fac-\\\\ntors affecting the public health agencies‚Äô skilled and layper-\\\\nson search patterns with indications for targeted communica-\\\\ntions during emergencies and outbreaks. Rathore et\\xa0al. [44] \\\\nhave suggested an emergency tackling response unit using \\\\nIoT-based wireless network of wearable devices called body \\\\narea networks (BANs). The device consists of ‚Äúintelligent \\\\nconstruction,‚Äù a model that helps in processing and decision \\\\nmaking from the data obtained from the sensors. The system \\\\nwas able to process millions of users‚Äô wireless BAN data to \\\\nprovide an emergency response in real-time.\\\\nConsultation online is becoming increasingly common \\\\nand a possible solution to the scarcity of healthcare resources \\\\nand inefficient delivery of resources. Numerous online con-\\\\nsultation sites do however struggle to attract customers who \\\\nare prepared to pay and maintain them, and health care pro-\\\\nviders on the site have the additional challenge to stand out \\\\n1479\\\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\\\n1 3\\\\nfrom a large number of doctors who can provide similar \\\\nservices [45]. In this research, Jiang et\\xa0al. [45] used ML \\\\napproaches to mine massive service data, in order (1) to \\\\ndefine the important characteristics related to patient pay-\\\\nment rather than free trial appointments, (2) explore the rela-\\\\ntive importance of those features, and (3) understand how \\\\nthese attributes work concerning payment, whether linearly \\\\nor not. The dataset refers to the largest online medical con-\\\\nsultation platform in China, covering 1,582,564 consulta-\\\\ntion documents among patient pairs between 2009 and 2018. \\\\nThe results showed that compared with features relating to \\\\nreputation as a physician, service-related features such as \\\\nquality of service (e.g., intensity of consultation dialogue \\\\nand response rate), the source of patients (e.g., online vs \\\\noffline patients), and the involvement of patients (e.g., social \\\\nreturns and previous treatments revealed). To facilitate pay-\\\\nment, it is important to promote multiple timely responses \\\\nin patient-provider interactions.\\\\nPharmacovigilance\\\\nPharmacovigilance requires tracking and identification of \\\\nadverse drug reactions (ADRs) after launch, to guarantee \\\\npatient safety. ADR events‚Äô approximate social cost per year \\\\nreaches a billion dollars, showing it as a significant aspect \\\\nof the medical care system [46]. Data mining findings from \\\\nadverse event reports (AERs) revealed that mild to lethal \\\\nreactions might be caused in paclitaxel among which doc-\\\\netaxel is linked with the lethal reaction while the remain-\\\\ning 4 drugs were not associated with hypersensitivity [47] \\\\nwhile testing ADR‚Äôs ‚Äúhypersensitivity‚Äù to six anticancer \\\\nagents [47]. Harpaz et\\xa0al. [46] disagreed with the theory \\\\nthat adverse events might be caused not just due to a single \\\\nmedication but also due to a mixture of synthetic drugs. It \\\\nis found that there is a correlation between a minimum of \\\\none drug and two AEs or two drugs and one AE in 84% \\\\nof AERs studies. Harpaz R et\\xa0al. [47] improved precision \\\\nin the identification of ADRs by jointly considering sev-\\\\neral data sources. When using EHRs that are available pub-\\\\nlicly in conjunction with the AER studies of the FDA, they \\\\nachieved a 31% (on average) increase in detection [45]. The \\\\nauthors identified dose-dependent ADRs with the help of \\\\nmodels built from structured as well as unstructured EHR \\\\ndata [48]. Of the top 5 ADR-related drugs, 4 were observed \\\\nto be dose-related [49]. The use of text data that is unstruc-\\\\ntured in EHRs [50]; pharmacovigilance operation was also \\\\ngiven priority.\\\\nADRs are uncommon in conventional pharmacovigi-\\\\nlance, though it is possible to get false signals while finding \\\\na connection between a drug and any potential ADRs. These \\\\nfalse alarms can be avoided because there is already a list of \\\\npotential ADRs that can be of great help in potential phar-\\\\nmacovigilance activities [18].\\\\nOvercoming the\\xa0language barrier\\\\nHaving electronic health records shared worldwide can be \\\\nbeneficial in analyzing and comparing disease incidence and \\\\ntreatments in different countries. However, every country \\\\nwould use their language for data recording. This language \\\\nbarrier can be dealt with the help of multilingual language \\\\nmodels, which would allow diversified opportunities for \\\\nData Science proliferation and to develop a model for per-\\\\nsonalization of services. These models will be able to under-\\\\nstand the semantics ‚Äî the grammatical structure and rules \\\\nof the language along with the context ‚Äî the general under-\\\\nstanding of words in different contexts.\\\\nFor example: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll meet you at the river bank.‚Äù\\\\n‚ÄúI have to deposit some money in my bank account.‚Äù\\\\nThe word bank means different things in the two contexts, \\\\nand a well-trained language model should be able to dif-\\\\nferentiate between these two. Cross-lingual language model \\\\ntrains on multiple languages simultaneously. Some of the \\\\ncross lingual language models include:\\\\nmBERT ‚Äî the multilingual BERT which was developed \\\\nby Google Research team.\\\\nXLM ‚Äî cross lingual model developed by Facebook AI, \\\\nwhich is an improvisation over mBERT.\\\\nMultifit ‚Äî a QRNN-based model developed by Fast.Ai \\\\nthat addresses challenges faced by low resource language \\\\nmodels.\\\\nChallenges\\\\nMillions of data points are accessible for EHR-based pheno-\\\\ntyping involving a large number of clinical elements inside \\\\nthe EHRs. Like sequence data, handling and controlling the \\\\ncomplete data of millions of individuals would also become \\\\na major challenge [51]. The key challenges faced include:\\\\n‚Ä¢\\\\t The data collected was mostly either unorganized or inac-\\\\ncurate, thus posing a problem to gain insights into it.\\\\n‚Ä¢\\\\t The correct balance between preserving patient-centric \\\\ninformation and ensuring the quality and accessibility of \\\\nthis data is difficult to decide.\\\\n‚Ä¢\\\\t Data standardization, maintaining privacy, efficient stor-\\\\nage, and transfers require a lot of manpower to constantly \\\\nmonitor and make sure that the needs are met.\\\\n‚Ä¢\\\\t Integrating genomic data into medical studies is criti-\\\\ncal due to the absence of standards for producing \\\\nnext-generation sequencing (NGS) data, handling bio-\\\\n1480\\\\nIrish Journal of Medical Science (1971 -) (2022) 191:1473‚Äì1483\\\\n1 3\\\\ninformatics, data deposition, and supporting medical \\\\ndecision-making [52].\\\\n‚Ä¢\\\\t Language barrier when dealing data\\\\nFuture directions\\\\nHealthcare services are constantly on the lookout for bet-\\\\nter options for improving the quality of treatment. It has \\\\nembraced technological innovations intending to develop \\\\nfor a better future. Big data is a revolution in the world of \\\\nhealth care. The attitude of patients, doctors, and health-\\\\ncare providers to care delivery has only just begun to \\\\ntransform. The discussed use of big data is just the ice-\\\\nberg edge. With the proliferation of data science and the \\\\nadvent of various data-driven applications, the health sec-\\\\ntor remains a leading provider of data-driven solutions to \\\\na better life and tailored services to its customers. Data \\\\nscientists can gain meaningful insights into improving \\\\nthe productivity of pharmaceutical and medical services \\\\nthrough their broad range of data on the healthcare sec-\\\\ntor including financial, clinical, R&D, administration, and \\\\noperational details.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nLarger patient datasets can be obtained from medical \\\\ncare organizations that include data from surveillance, \\\\nlaboratory, genomics, imaging, and electronic healthcare \\\\nrecords. This data requires proper management and analy-\\\\nsis to derive meaningful information. Long-term visions \\\\nfor self-management, improved patient care, and treat-\\\\nment can be realized by utilizing big data. Data Science \\\\ncan bring in instant predictive analytics that can be used \\\\nto obtain insights into a variety of disease processes and \\\\ndeliver patient-centric treatment. It will help to improvise \\\\nthe ability of researchers in the field of science, epide-\\\\nmiological studies, personalized medicine, etc. Predictive \\\\naccuracy, however, is highly dependent on efficient data \\\\nintegration obtained from different sources to enable it to be \\\\ngeneralized. Modern health organizations can revolutionize \\\\nmedical therapy and personalized medicine by integrating \\\\nbiomedical and health data. Data science can effectively \\\\nhandle, evaluate, and interpret big data by creating new \\\\npaths in comprehensive medical care.\\\\nFunding\\u2002 Open access funding provided by Manipal Academy of Higher \\\\n \\\\nEducation, Manipal.\\\\nDeclarations\\u2002\\\\nConflict of interest\\u2002 The authors declare no competing interests.\\\\nOpen Access\\u2002 This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attri-\\\\nbution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adapta-\\\\ntion, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long \\\\nas you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, \\\\nprovide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes \\\\nwere made.

The services provided during HHC include skilled \\\\nnursing care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and social work.2 As \\\\npart of routine HHC visits, clinicians assess for early signs of deterioration to reduce the \\\\nrisk of adverse events.3 Despite comprehensive assessments and interventions, nearly one \\\\nin five patients are hospitalized or visit the emergency department (ED) during the time \\\\nthey receive HHC services.4‚Äì6 Other initiatives aimed at hospitalization reduction include \\\\nfinancial incentives;4 however, readmission rates have not improved.7 Estimates show that \\\\napproximately 40% of hospitalizations and ED visits are due to preventable ambulatory \\\\ncare-sensitive conditions8 that could be avoided with timely and tailored interventions.9\\\\nIn recent years, there has been growing evidence that machine learning algorithms can \\\\npredict the risk of deterioration in patients by analyzing electronic health record (EHR) \\\\ndocumentation.10 HHC agencies have their own EHR which provides a central place to \\\\nHobensack et al.\\\\nPage 2\\\\nInt J Med Inform. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nstore information describing patients‚Äô diagnosis, problems, interventions, and outcomes. In \\\\nHHC, nurses are the largest group of clinicians, hence nursing documentation accounts \\\\nfor a majority of EHR documentation. Other users of the EHR in HHC include physical, \\\\noccupational, and speech therapists, and social workers.11 Machine learning algorithms can \\\\nidentify patients who may experience an adverse event by discovering patterns in previously \\\\ndocumented data.12 The value of machine learning has been demonstrated in the acute care \\\\nsetting to detect various adverse events13,14 such as mortality15 and the activation of rapid \\\\nresponse teams.16 This has led to the development of clinical decision support systems that \\\\nproactively notify clinicians to patients at risk for experiencing an adverse outcome.17,18 \\\\nHowever, the extent to which machine learning has been applied in the HHC setting for risk \\\\nprediction has not been previously reported.\\\\nAnother consideration when assessing the value of machine learning is understanding the \\\\npredictors driving the algorithm. Previous studies have demonstrated the versatility of \\\\nusing machine learning to examine a wide range of predictors from symptoms to social \\\\ndeterminants of health.19,20 However, while it is known that social determinants21 and \\\\npsychological factors influence health outcomes,22 the extent to which these factors are \\\\nincluded in machine learning algorithms in the HHC setting is unknown.19,20\\\\nRecent literature has called for an increase in informatics, such as machine learning, in the \\\\nHHC setting to bring documentation-driven evidence to clinicians at the point of care.23‚Äì25 \\\\nDespite HHC being one of the fastest growing sectors of healthcare26 and the benefits of \\\\nmachine learning to predict patients at risk,27 no previous studies have summarized the state \\\\nof the science on machine learning applied to EHR data in the HHC setting. To address these \\\\nknowledge gaps, this study aims to critically appraise and synthesize information on the \\\\napplication of machine learning to predict a priori specified adverse outcomes using EHR \\\\ndata in the HHC setting. Our secondary aim was to summarize the different dimensions \\\\nof predictors (i.e., biological, psychological, and interpersonal) used to build the machine \\\\nlearning algorithms guided by the Biopsychosocial Model.\\\\nMaterials and methods\\\\nThis scoping review was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items \\\\nfor Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) \\\\nguidelines.28 The protocol describing this study was registered in Open Science Framework \\\\n(osf.io/g5zrj). Studies were eligible to be included if they addressed skilled health services \\\\nprovided in HHC, applied machine learning algorithms to predict adverse outcomes a priori, \\\\nused EHR data, focused on the adult population, and were published in English. Full \\\\ntext papers and conference proceedings covering quantitative machine learning algorithms \\\\nwere included. For this study, adverse events were defined as outcomes related to patient \\\\ndeterioration.29 Studies were excluded if they took place in a nursing home or skilled \\\\nnursing facility or focused on smart homes, sensors, or robots because they were outside \\\\nthe scope of this manuscript.

There was no restriction on the publication date. The full search strategy \\\\ncan be found in Appendix A. Our screening team included two registered nurses and two \\\\nadvanced practice nurses with informatics expertise (MH, JS, DS, MT). After duplicates \\\\nwere removed, all relevant studies were screened by two reviewers. Any conflicts were \\\\nresolved through discussion between the three reviewers until consensus was reached. This \\\\nprocess was repeated with full-text studies.\\\\nThe data extraction template was drafted by two co-authors (MH, MT). Other co-authors \\\\nwere invited to modify the template prior to charting the items. The extraction template \\\\nincluded information about the study and sample characteristics, algorithm overview, \\\\nmachine learning approaches, and algorithm performance. Upon consensus with the \\\\nappropriate variables to extract (e.g., purpose, data source, best-performing algorithm), two \\\\nreviewers (JS, DS) independently charted the data using the software, Covidence. A third \\\\nreviewer went through and resolved any disagreements (MH).\\\\nData were synthesized by mapping predictors to the Biopsychosocial Model.31‚Äì33 This \\\\nmodel assumes that to understand health holistically, a range of characteristics should be \\\\nconsidered, including an individual‚Äôs social, psychological, and behavioral dimensions.31,32 \\\\nLehman et al adapted this model to include the following dimensions: biological, \\\\npsychological, and interpersonal.33 The biological dimension encompasses medical histories \\\\ninfluencing the physical body; the psychological dimension encompasses coping and health \\\\nbehaviors; and the interpersonal dimension encompasses social support.33 Two reviewers \\\\nwere tasked with categorizing the predictors into one of the three dimensions of the \\\\nBiopsychosocial Model. Discrepancies were resolved through consensus meetings with the \\\\nscreening team (MH, JS, DS).\\\\nFour reviewers (MH, JS, DS, MT) performed a risk of bias analysis using the Prediction \\\\nModel Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST).34 One reviewer (MH) resolved \\\\ndisagreements after discussing the conflicts with another member of the screening team \\\\nwho has expertise in machine learning (MT). PROBAST facilitates risk of bias assessment \\\\nin four domains: participants, predictors, outcome, and analysis, and is specific to prediction \\\\nmodel studies. Per the PROBAST guidelines, if a study has at least one criterion indicating \\\\nan unclear or high risk of bias, the overall risk of bias for that study would be unclear or \\\\nhigh.\\\\nResults\\\\nOur initial search yielded 1,644 studies from four databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, \\\\nand Scopus). After duplicates were removed (n = 190), there were 1,454 studies eligible \\\\nfor title and abstract screening. A total of 1,378 studies were excluded, and 76 studies \\\\nwere moved to full-text review. Of those, 20 studies were included for synthesis.

The \\\\nPRISMA flow diagram35 presented in Figure 1 summarizes the study selection process.\\\\nStudy characteristics\\\\nResults revealed the global advances in integrating machine learning into the HHC setting. \\\\nSix countries were represented in this review (30%). Ten studies (50%) did not include a \\\\nclear definition of HHC in their region. Most studies took place in the United States (n = 9; \\\\n45%)36‚Äì44 and Canada (n = 4; 20%)45‚Äì48 and used data retrospectively collected from 2015 \\\\nand earlier (n = 13; 65%)36‚Äì39,42‚Äì44,46,47,49‚Äì52 although some studies did not specify \\\\ndates (n = 3; 15%).40,48,53 The majority of studies were published between 2019 and 2022 (n \\\\n= 13; 65%).37,40‚Äì44,46,47,49,51,52,54,55\\\\nSample characteristics\\\\nMost studies did not focus on patients with a specific disease (n = 12; 60%). Among \\\\nstudies that did focus on a disease-specific population, patients with heart failure (n = 3; \\\\n15%)36,39,53 and advanced cancer (n = 2; 10%)50,55 were the most common. The number of \\\\nparticipants included in the studies ranged from 284 to 317,621. A summary of study and \\\\nsample characteristics is provided in Table 1.\\\\nAlgorithm overview\\\\nWhile all studies used data from the EHR, some studies included standardized assessments \\\\nstored in the EHR (n = 18; 90%).36‚Äì50,52,54,55 Standardized assessments, housed within the \\\\nEHR, include a set of standardized data elements allowing for easier comparison across \\\\ndifferent settings.56 For example, the United States‚Äô federally mandated Outcome and \\\\nAssessment Information Set (OASIS) assesses the patient‚Äôs functional status by collecting \\\\ndata about activities of daily living using a standardized set of questions such as describing \\\\nthe patient‚Äôs ability to ‚Äútransfer in and out of bed.‚Äù57 In the United States, EHR data \\\\n(e.g., demographics, clinical assessments) are typically collected by nurses within the \\\\nHHC agency,11 siloed from healthcare data collected in other care settings.23 The most \\\\ncited standardized assessment was the OASIS (n = 8; 40%)36‚Äì38,40‚Äì44 and Residential \\\\nAssessment Instrument - Home Care (RAI-HC) (n = 5; 25%).45‚Äì49 OASIS is a patient-\\\\nspecific assessment tool required by Medicare in the United States to guide a patient‚Äôs plan \\\\nof care, determine reimbursement, and collect quality measures in HHC.57 Similarly, the \\\\nRAI-HC is used in Canada to assess ‚Äúlong stay home care clients‚Äô health status, need for \\\\ncare, and basic background on housing and informal caregivers,‚Äù helping to guide care and \\\\ncollect quality indicators.58 In the included studies, only three studies included clinical notes \\\\nas a data source (15%).41,43,44\\\\nMost studies considered variables from all three domains of the Biopsychosocial Model (n = \\\\n12; 60%): biological (e.g., age, hematocrit, fall history), psychological (e.g., depression, \\\\nmemory deficit, coping), and interpersonal (e.g., lives alone, social support, informal \\\\ncaregiver status).38,40‚Äì42,44‚Äì50,52 Predictors that did not map to one of the three domains \\\\nwere categorized as ‚ÄúOther‚Äù which included variables such as the number of days in the \\\\nhospital, hospital utilization history, and the number of HHC visits.

Although \\\\nsimilar reviews were conducted in the acute and ambulatory settings,64,65 this study was the \\\\nfirst to focus on the HHC setting, which represents one of the fastest-growing healthcare \\\\nsectors.26\\\\nMost studies (65%) included in this review were published between 2019 and 2022, \\\\nsuggesting a recent uptake of machine learning in the HHC setting.64,66 With that, 65% \\\\nof the studies used data collected from 2015 or earlier, indicating a delay between \\\\nretrospective data availability and analysis. This may be related to the lack of regulation \\\\nand standardization of EHR systems and data collected in the HHC setting globally, \\\\nwhich may increase the difficulty and time needed to extract, clean, and analyze the \\\\ndata.67,68 Generating global policies similar to the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care \\\\nTransformation (IMPACT) Act, which advances standardized data in post-acute care \\\\nsettings69 could lead to improved interoperability and analytical efficiency in the near future.\\\\nThis review paper highlights a gap in current research around the implementation of \\\\nmachine learning algorithms into the HHC clinical setting.30 A previous systematic review \\\\ndescribing prediction algorithms in post-acute care found that among the 37 models \\\\nreviewed, very few were ever implemented in practice.70 While clinical validation is \\\\nunderway in the acute care setting through randomized controlled trials,71‚Äì73 there is still \\\\na significant gap in the HHC setting. Shifting focus from an end goal of performance \\\\noptimization to practical clinical implementation is imperative to achieve the intention of \\\\nalmost all health-related machine learning algorithms ‚Äì to advance health and improve \\\\noutcomes. Seneviratne et al recommends that when building machine learning algorithms, \\\\ndevelopers should proactively consider clinical actionability, patient safety, and cost-utility \\\\nto optimize implementation in the clinical setting.74\\\\nAlthough this study examined the global scope of machine learning in HHC across six \\\\ncountries, it is important to highlight some regional differences. For example, in the United \\\\nStates, HHC is defined as a period of 30 to 60 days where skilled services such as nursing, \\\\nphysical, occupational, and speech therapy are provided to help patients transition back to \\\\nthe community.42,44 Alternatively, in Spain, the purpose of HHC is to provide interventions \\\\naimed at substituting inpatient hospitalization in a period of time that does not exceed \\\\nthe expected length of an inpatient hospitalization.52 Concerningly, half of the studies \\\\nincluded in this review did not provide detailed information on the structure of HHC in their \\\\ncountry. The differences in HHC structure and purpose also influence EHR documentation75 \\\\nwhich was not thoroughly discussed in all articles. Given the variation of HHC and EHRs \\\\nglobally,76‚Äì78 future studies should provide a detailed description of their regional HHC \\\\nstructure and EHR systems to help distinguish differences in patient populations, goals, \\\\ntimelines, and care structures. Providing further clarity around regional differences in the \\\\nHobensack et al.\\\\nPage 7\\\\nInt J Med Inform. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nstructure of HHC and EHR systems could lead to better tailoring and predictor selection \\\\nwhen developing machine learning algorithms globally.\\\\nStandardized assessments, such as OASIS and the RAI-HC, are commonly stored in the \\\\nEHR. Using standardized assessments can support interoperability, or the ability to exchange \\\\nhealth information, across systems or within a health system.79 In addition, the utilization \\\\nof standardized assessments has led to more evidence-based, consistent, and holistic \\\\nassessments among clinicians.80,81 In fact, all three domains of the Biopsychosocial Model \\\\nwere aligned with studies that used a standardized assessment tool as their data source, \\\\nsuggesting that standardized assessments lead to more comprehensive documentation. Thus, \\\\nincorporating standardized assessments into the EHR could improve comparability, access to \\\\ndata, interoperability, and generalizability in the HHC setting.\\\\nOur results reveal that most studies include predictors from all three domains of the \\\\nBiopsychosocial Model. Unsurprisingly, and similar to a previous study,82 biological \\\\ncharacteristics were included in all studies. Fewer studies included psychological (e.g., \\\\nmental health) and/or interpersonal (e.g., social determinants of health) predictors in their \\\\nmachine learning algorithms. Of the studies that did include these dimensions, they were \\\\noften from the structured standardized assessments. For psychological predictors, this may \\\\nbe related to using an assessment tool that does not comprehensively consider psychological \\\\ncharacteristics. For interpersonal predictors, this might be related to limited data capture \\\\nand documentation of social determinants of health in EHR systems.83 Previous studies \\\\nhave suggested that including social determinants of health can improve machine learning \\\\nprediction among individuals from racial or ethnic minorities.21,84,85 The inclusion of \\\\npsychological and interpersonal characteristics in machine learning algorithms could lead to \\\\nimproved equity in risk identification85 and proactive interventions for patients with mental \\\\nhealth conditions or social risk factors who are often stigmatized in healthcare.86,87\\\\nThe most frequently cited outcome of interest was hospitalization. In HHC, one of the \\\\nprimary goals is to prevent avoidable hospitalizations.88 Hospitalization rates reflect care \\\\nquality,4 with reducing readmission being financially incentivized;4 thus, we anticipate \\\\nthe number of machine learning algorithms focused on hospitalization to continue to be \\\\ncommon. Other outcomes specific to HHC, such as self-management, should be explored in \\\\nfuture studies to investigate other ways to reduce the risk of specific adverse outcomes prior \\\\nto hospitalization.89 In terms of disease conditions, a majority of the studies in this review \\\\ndid not focus on patients with a specific disease but rather on the general HHC population. \\\\nThe few studies that specified a condition focused on patients with heart failure or cancer. \\\\nFuture studies might examine specific disease-related predictors to identify characteristics \\\\nthat put specific populations at risk and inform the development of tailored interventions to \\\\nimprove patient outcomes.\\\\nThe wide range of sample sizes in the included studies demonstrates the versatility \\\\nof machine learning algorithms in studies with various sample sizes.90 Although small \\\\nsamples can be problematic for specific algorithms, such as Neural networks, other \\\\nalgorithms, such as Na√Øve bayes, can better accommodate smaller samples since it assumes \\\\nclass independence.91 However, data-demanding algorithms like Neural networks may \\\\nHobensack et al.\\\\nPage 8\\\\nInt J Med Inform. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nbe more prone to overfitting with smaller samples, leading to overestimated algorithm \\\\nperformance.92 Thus, we encourage researchers to consider sample size when determining \\\\nthe appropriate algorithm to apply to the data.\\\\nTree based algorithms (e.g., Decision tree, ADABoost, Classification and regression trees, \\\\nRandom forest) were frequently cited in this review and are known to be a reliable method \\\\nin biomedical literature.93 An advantage of a Decision tree is its interpretability,94 meaning \\\\nthat humans can understand the informative features driving the algorithm‚Äôs performance.95 \\\\nAlternatively, ‚Äúblack box‚Äù algorithms, such as Neural networks, are less interpretable, which \\\\nmay indicate why they were used less frequently94 in studies included in this review. \\\\nHowever, there has been a rise in the use of Neural networks96,97 applied to EHR data, given \\\\nits increased performance and reduction in preprocessing and feature engineering compared \\\\nto other explainable algorithms.97 Recent literature has published model-agnostic methods \\\\nto increase the interpretability of ‚Äúblack box‚Äù models, such as Shapley Values, which help \\\\nto explain features that are more informative (i.e., feature importance).95 Therefore, future \\\\nstudies may be more apt to apply Neural networks in the HHC setting. However, the studies \\\\nin this review that applied Neural networks did not outperform alternative algorithms, \\\\nsuggesting that other models should not be abandoned altogether.\\\\nAdditionally, NLP, an algorithm used to process unstructured text in clinical notes, was \\\\ninfrequently applied in studies included in this review. NLP is a method that takes \\\\ntext contained in clinical notes and makes it accessible to machine learning algorithms \\\\nby transforming the text into a structured form.98 Eighty percent of healthcare data is \\\\nunstructured data (e.g., clinical notes).99 Previous studies have demonstrated the value \\\\nof analyzing clinical notes to reflect clinician concerns to improve risk prediction in \\\\nHHC.44,100‚Äì102 More specifically, studies have found that additional information about \\\\npatients‚Äô social determinants103 and mental health104 can be found in clinical notes. Thus, \\\\nfuture studies in HHC might explore using NLP to extract additional information about \\\\na patient‚Äôs biological, psychological, and interpersonal characteristics to improve risk \\\\npredictive performance.\\\\nOverall, there were variations in algorithm performance among the included studies; \\\\nhowever, comparing algorithms with different performance metrics is challenging. Each \\\\nperformance metric has its advantages and disadvantages. F-score, which handles \\\\nimbalanced data, gives more weight to the majority class regardless of if it is the outcome \\\\nof interest.105 AUC is better for ranking overall prediction because it equally weights \\\\nboth classes.105 The variety of measures used to report algorithm performance suggests \\\\nno general consensus on a particular measure of best use.106 Therefore, it is important \\\\nthat the selection of performance metrics is thoughtfully considered and explained in the \\\\nmanuscript.107\\\\nLimitations\\\\nA few limitations of this scoping review need to be addressed. First, we recognize that \\\\nsub-optimal machine learning performance may be driven by the dataset‚Äôs quality and \\\\ninfluence the results. Additionally, the development of machine learning in recent years may \\\\nHobensack et al.\\\\nPage 9\\\\nInt J Med Inform. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2024 February 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nhave contributed to improved machine learning performance. The scope of this study did \\\\nnot include an in-depth analysis of how the data was collected, but future studies should \\\\nconsider the bias contained in these data. Similarly, no studies rigorously evaluated bias \\\\n(e.g., racial, age) in algorithm performance recognizing an important gap to consider in \\\\nfuture research. This review did not find HHC studies that compared prediction of machine \\\\nlearning models with clinical expert judgment and we recommend exploring this comparison \\\\nin the future studies. This scoping review contains multiple studies published by the same \\\\nresearch team, which suggests that minimal teams have published in this area within the \\\\nlast few years, potentially skewing the results. We mapped predictors to the Biopsychosocial \\\\nModel to get a comprehensive overview of predictors considered in the included machine \\\\nlearning models; however, an alternative framework may have led to a more granular \\\\ncategorization of predictors.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nWith the increased demand for healthcare provided in the home, we anticipate the number \\\\nof machine learning algorithms in HHC to continue to increase. Results from this review \\\\ndemonstrate the feasibility and potential of machine learning to support clinical care in the \\\\nHHC setting. Future studies should consider how these machine learning algorithms can \\\\nbe packaged into decision support systems that can guide clinical decision-making at the \\\\npoint of care to reduce adverse events, such as hospitalizations. In addition, incorporating \\\\npsychological and interpersonal characteristics into machine learning models will support \\\\ncomprehensive, holistic risk prediction. To enable widespread adoption of machine \\\\nlearning, stakeholders should consider how they can further promote the standardization \\\\nof documentation elements in the HHC setting.\\\\nSupplementary Material\\\\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\\\\nAcknowledgements\\\\nThis work was supported by the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) [grant T32NR007969 (MH, DS), \\\\nR01 NR018831]; the Jonas Scholarship (MH), and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [grant R01 \\\\nHS027742].\\\\nReferences\\\\n1.

In medicine, excitement about \\\\nhuman-level performance (1) of ML for health is balanced against ethical concerns, such \\\\nas the potential for these tools to exacerbate existing health disparities (2‚Äì5).

Even more worrisome, healthcare models designed \\\\nto optimize referrals to long-term care management programs for millions of patients have \\\\nbeen found to exclude Black patients with similar health conditions compared to white \\\\npatients from care management programs (8).\\\\nMachine learning (ML):\\\\nthe study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience\\\\nML model:\\\\nan algorithm that has been trained on data for a specific use case\\\\nAlgorithm:\\\\na finite sequence of well-defined instructions used to solve a class of problems\\\\nA growing body of literature wrestles with the social implications of ML and technology. \\\\nSome of this work, termed critical data studies, is from a social science perspective (9, \\\\n10), whereas other work leads with a technical and computer science perspective (11‚Äì13). \\\\nWhile there is scholarship addressing social implications and algorithmic fairness in general, \\\\nthere has been less work at the intersection of health, ML, and fairness (14‚Äì16), despite the \\\\npotential life-or-death impacts of ML models (8, 17).\\\\nAlgorithmic fairness:\\\\nthe study of definitions and methods related to the justice of models\\\\nWhile researchers looking to develop ethical ML models for health can begin by drawing \\\\non bioethics principles (18, 19), these principles are designed to inform research and \\\\nclinical care practices. How these principles could inform the ML model development \\\\nethical pipeline remains understudied. We note that there has been significant work on other \\\\nimportant ethical issues that relate to ML and health, including reviews of consent and \\\\nprivacy (20), which we do not address here. Instead, we focus on equity in ML models that \\\\noperate on health data. We focus primarily on differences between groups induced by, or \\\\nrelated to, the model development pipeline, drawing on both the bioethics principle of justice \\\\nand the established social justice centering of public health ethics (21). Unjust differences in \\\\nquality and outcomes of healthcare between groups often reflect existing societal disparities \\\\nfor disadvantaged groups. We consider other bioethics principles such as beneficence and \\\\nnonmaleficence, but focus them primarily on groups of patients rather than on individuals.\\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 2\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

Here, we motivate the ethical considerations in the pipeline with a case \\\\nstudy of Black mothers in the United States, who die in childbirth at a rate three times \\\\nhigher than white women (22). This inequity is unjust because it connects to a history of \\\\nreproductive injustices faced by Black women in the United States, from gynecological \\\\nexperimentation on enslaved women to forced sterilizations (23, 24).\\\\n1.\\\\nProblem selection: This disparity occurs in part during problem selection \\\\nbecause maternal mortality is an understudied problem (25).\\\\n2.\\\\nData collection: Even after accounting for problem selection, data collection \\\\nfrom hospitals may differ in quality and quantity.

First, we look at problem selection, and explain \\\\nhow funding for ML for health research can lead to injustice. We then examine how data \\\\ncollection processes in funded research can amplify inequity and unfairness. We follow this \\\\nby exploring outcome definition and algorithm building, listing the multitude of factors that \\\\ncan impact model performance and explaining how these differences in performance relate \\\\nto issues of justice. We close with audits that should be considered for more robust and just \\\\ndeployments of models in health, as well as recommendations to practitioners for ethical, \\\\nfair, and just ML deployments.\\\\n2. PROBLEM SELECTION\\\\nThere are many factors that influence the selection of a research problem, from interest \\\\nto available funding. However, problem selection can also be a matter of justice if the \\\\nresearch questions that are proposed, and ultimately funded, focus on the health needs of \\\\nadvantaged groups. Below we provide examples of how disparities in research teams and \\\\nfunding priorities exacerbate existing socioeconomic, racial, and gender injustices.\\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 4\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\n2.1. Global Health Injustice\\\\nThe so-called 10/90 gap refers to the fact that the vast majority of health research dollars \\\\nare spent on problems that affect a small fraction of the global population (31, 32). Diseases \\\\nthat are most common in lower-income countries receive far less funding than diseases \\\\nthat are most common in high-income countries (33) (relative to the number of individuals \\\\nthey affect). As an example, 26 poverty-related diseases account for 14% of the global \\\\ndisease burden, but receive only 1.3% of global health-related research and development \\\\nexpenditure. Nearly 60% of the burden of poverty-related neglected diseases occurs in \\\\nwestern and eastern sub-Saharan Africa, as well as South Asia. Malaria, tuberculosis, and \\\\nHIV/AIDS all have shares of global health-related research and development expenditure \\\\nthat are at least five times smaller than their share of global disease burden (33). This \\\\ndifference in rates of funding represents an injustice because it further exacerbates the \\\\ndisadvantages faced by populations in the Global South. While efforts like the ‚ÄúAll Of \\\\nUs‚Äù Research Program (34) and 23andMe‚Äôs call for collaboration (35) seek to collect more \\\\ninclusive data, these efforts have come under criticism for not reflecting global health \\\\nconcerns, particularly among Indigenous groups (36).\\\\nGlobal South:\\\\ncountries on one side of the North‚ÄìSouth divide, the other side being the countries of the \\\\nGlobal North\\\\n2.2. Racial Injustice\\\\nRacial bias affects which health problems are prioritized and funded. For example, sickle \\\\ncell disease and cystic fibrosis are both genetic disorders of similar severity, but sickle cell \\\\ndisease is more common in Black patients, while cystic fibrosis is more common in white \\\\npatients. In the United States, however, cystic fibrosis receives 3.4 times more funding per \\\\naffected individual from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the largest funder of \\\\nUS clinical research, and hundreds of times more private funding (37). The disparities in \\\\nfunding persist despite the 1972 Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act, which recognizes that \\\\nsickle cell has been neglected by the wider research community. Further, screening for sickle \\\\ncell disease is viewed by some as unfair targeting (38), and Black patients with the disease \\\\nwho seek treatment are often maligned as drug abusers (39).\\\\n2.3. Gender Injustice\\\\nWomen‚Äôs health conditions like endometriosis are poorly understood; as a consequence, \\\\neven basic statistics like the prevalence of endometriosis remain unknown, with estimates \\\\nranging from 1% to 10% of the population (40, 41). Similarly, the menstrual cycle is \\\\nstigmatized and understudied (40, 42), producing a dearth of understanding that undermines \\\\nthe health of half the global population. Basic facts about the menstrual cycle‚Äîincluding \\\\nwhich menstrual experiences are normal and which are predictive of pathology‚Äîremain \\\\nunknown (40). This lack of focus on the menstrual cycle propagates into clinical practice \\\\nand data collection despite evidence that it affects many aspects of health and disease (43, \\\\n44). Menstrual cycles are also not often recorded in clinical records and global health \\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 5\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\ndata (40). In fact, until 2019 the NIH did not have an R01 grant, the NIH‚Äôs original and \\\\nhistorically oldest grant mechanism, relating to the influence of sex and gender on health \\\\nand disease (45). Notably, recent work has moved to target such understudied problems \\\\nvia ambulatory women‚Äôs health-tracking mobile apps. These crowd-sourcing efforts stand \\\\nto accelerate women‚Äôs health research by collecting data from cohorts that are orders of \\\\nmagnitude larger than those used in previous studies (40).\\\\n2.4. Diversity of the Scientific Workforce\\\\nThe diversity of the scientific workforce profoundly influences the problems studied \\\\nand contributes to biases in problem selection (46). Research shows that scientists from \\\\nunderrepresented racial and gender groups tend to prioritize different research topics. They \\\\nproduce more novel research, but their innovations are taken up at lower rates (47). Female \\\\nscientists tend to study different scientific subfields, even within the same larger field [for \\\\nexample, within sociology, they have been historically better represented on papers about \\\\nsociology of the family or early childhood (48)], and express different opinions about ethical \\\\ndilemmas in computer science (49). Proposals from white researchers in the United States \\\\nare more likely to be funded by the NIH than proposals from Black researchers (50, 51), \\\\nwhich in turns affects what topics are given preference. For example, a higher fraction of \\\\nNIH proposals from Black scientists study community and population-level health (50). \\\\nOverall, this evidence suggests that diversifying the scientific workforce will lead to problem \\\\nselection that more equitably represents the interests and needs of the population as a whole.\\\\n3. DATA COLLECTION\\\\nThe role of health data is ever-expanding, with new data sources routinely being integrated \\\\ninto decision-making around health policy and design. This wealth of high-quality data, \\\\ncoupled with advancements in ML models, has played a significant role in accelerating \\\\nthe use of computationally informed policy and practice to strengthen healthcare and \\\\ndelivery platforms. Unfortunately, data can be biased in ways that have (or can lead to) \\\\ndisproportionate negative impacts on already marginalized groups. First, data on group \\\\nmembership can be completely absent. For instance, countries such as Canada and France \\\\ndo not record race and ethnicity in their nationalized health databases (52, 53), making \\\\nit impossible to study race-based disparities and hypotheses around associations of social \\\\ndeterminants of health. Second, data can be imbalanced. Recent work on acute kidney injury \\\\nachieved state-of-the-art prediction performance in a large dataset of 703,782 adult patients \\\\nusing 620,000 features; however, the authors noted that model performance was lower in \\\\nfemale patients since they make up 6.38% of patients in the training data (54). Other work \\\\nhas indicated that this issue cannot be simply addressed by pretraining a model in a more \\\\nbalanced data setting prior to fine-tuning on an imbalanced dataset (55). This indicates that a \\\\nmodel cannot be initialized with a balanced baseline representation that ameliorates issues of \\\\nimbalance in downstream tasks, and it suggests that we must solve this problem at the root, \\\\nbe it with more balanced comprehensive data, specialty learning algorithms, or combinations \\\\nthereof. Finally, while some sampling biases can be recognized and possibly corrected, \\\\nothers may be difficult to correct.

We consider two types of \\\\nprocesses that result in a loss of data. First, we examine processes that affect what kind \\\\nof information is collected (heterogenous data loss) across varying input types.

Heterogeneous Data Losses\\\\nSome data loss is specific to the data type, due to assumptions about noise that may have \\\\nbeen present during the collection process. However, data noise and missingness can cause \\\\nunjust inequities that impact populations in different ways. We cover four main data types: \\\\nrandomized controlled trials (RCTs), electronic health records (EHRs), administrative health \\\\ndata, and social media data.\\\\nHeterogeneous data loss:\\\\nthe process whereby data can be lost in collection due to the data type\\\\nData noise:\\\\nmeaningless information added to data that obscures the underlying information of the \\\\ndata\\\\nMissingness:\\\\nthe manner in which data are absent from a sample of the population\\\\n3.1.1. Randomized controlled trials.‚ÄîRCTs are often run specifically to gather \\\\nunbiased evidence of treatment effects. However, RCTs have notoriously aggressive \\\\nexclusion (or inclusion) criteria (57), which create study cohorts that are not representative \\\\nof general patient populations (58). In one study of RCTs used to define asthma treatment, \\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 7\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

There is a growing methodological literature designing methods to generalize \\\\nRCT treatment effects to other populations (60). However, current empirical evidence \\\\nindicates that such generalizations can be challenging given available data or may require \\\\nstrong assumptions in practice.\\\\nRandomized controlled trial (RCT):\\\\na study in which subjects are allocated by chance to receive one of several interventions\\\\n3.1.2. Electronic health records.‚ÄîMuch recent work in ML also leverages large EHR \\\\ndata. EHR data are a complex reflection of patient health, healthcare systems, and providers, \\\\nwhere data missingness is a known, and meaningful, problem (61). As one salient example, \\\\na large study of laboratory tests to model three-year survival found that healthcare process \\\\nfeatures had a stronger predictive value than the patient‚Äôs physiological feaures (62). Further, \\\\nnot all treatments investigated in RCTs can be easily approximated in EHRs (63).\\\\nElectronic health record (EHR):\\\\ndigital version of a patient‚Äôs clinical history that is maintained by the provider over time\\\\nBiases in EHR data may arise due to differences in patient populations, access to care, \\\\nor the availability of EHR systems (64). As an example, the widely used MIMIC-III \\\\nEHR dataset includes most patients who receive care at the intensive care units in Beth \\\\nIsrael Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), but this sample is obviously limited by which \\\\nindividuals have access to care at BIDMC, which has a largely white patient population \\\\n(14). In the United States, uninsured Black and Hispanic or Latin(o/x) patients, as well as \\\\nHispanic or Latin(o/x) Medicaid patients, are less likely to have primary care providers with \\\\nEHR systems, as compared to white patients with private insurance (65). Other work has \\\\nshown that gender discrimination in healthcare access has not been systematically studied in \\\\nIndia, primarily due to a lack of reliable data (66).\\\\n3.1.3. Administrative health records.‚ÄîIn addition to RCTs and EHRs, healthcare \\\\nbilling claims data, clinical registries, and linked health survey data are also common \\\\ndata sources in population health and health policy research (67, 68), with known biases \\\\nconcerning which populations are followed and who is able to participate. Translating \\\\nsuch research into practice is a crucial part of maintaining healthcare quality, and limited \\\\nparticipation of minority populations by sexual orientation and gender identity (69), race and \\\\nethnicity (70), and language (71) can lead to health interventions and policies that are not \\\\ninclusive and can create new injustices for these already marginalized groups.\\\\nIntervention:\\\\na treatment, procedure, or other action taken to prevent or treat disease or improve health \\\\nin other ways\\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 8\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

Social media data.‚ÄîData from social media platforms and search-based \\\\nresearch naturally consist of only individuals with internet access (72). Even small \\\\nchoices like limiting samples to those from desktop versus mobile platforms constitute \\\\na problematic distinction in non‚ÄìNorth American contexts (73). Beyond concerns about \\\\naccess to resources or geographic limitations, data collection and scraping pipelines for most \\\\nsocial media cohorts do not yield a random sample of individuals. Further, the common \\\\npractice of limiting analysis to those satisfying a specified threshold of occurrence can lead \\\\nto skewed data. As an example, when processing the large volume of Twitter data (7.6 \\\\nbillion tweets), researchers may first restrict to users who can be mapped to a US county \\\\n(1.78 billion), then to those Tweets that contain only English (1.64 billion tweets), and \\\\nfinally to users who made more than 30 posts (1.53 billion) (74).\\\\n3.2. Population-Specific Data Losses\\\\nAs with data types, the modern data deluge does not apply equally to all communities. \\\\nHistorically underserved groups are often underrepresented, misrepresented, or entirely \\\\nmissing from health data that inform consequential health policy decisions. When \\\\nindividuals from disadvantaged communities appear in observational datasets, they are \\\\nless likely to be accurately captured due to errors in data collection and systemic \\\\ndiscrimination. Larger genomics datasets often target European populations, producing \\\\ngenetic risk scores that are more accurate in individuals of European ancestry than other \\\\nancestries (75). We note four specific examples of populations that are commonly impacted: \\\\nlow- and middle-income nationals, transgender and gender nonconforming individuals, \\\\nundocumented migrants, and pregnant women.\\\\n3.2.1. Low- and middle-income nationals.‚ÄîHealth data are infrequently collected \\\\ndue to resource constraints, and even basic disease statistic data such as prevalence of \\\\nmortality rates can be challenging to find for low- and middle-income nations (73). When \\\\ndata are collected, they are not digitized and often contain errors. In 2001, the World Health \\\\nOrganization found that only 9 out of the 46 member states in sub-Saharan Africa could \\\\nproduce death statistics for a global assessment of the burden of disease, with data coverage \\\\noften less than 60% in these countries (76).\\\\n3.2.2. Transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals.‚ÄîThe healthcare \\\\nneeds and experiences of transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals are not well \\\\ndocumented in datasets (77) because documented sex, not gender identity, is what is \\\\nusually available. However, documented sex is often discordant with gender identity \\\\nfor transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals. Apart from health documentation \\\\nconcerns, transgender people are often concerned about their basic physical safety when \\\\nreporting their identities. In the United States, it was only in 2016, with the release of the US \\\\nTransgender Survey, that there was a meaningfully sized dataset‚Äî28,000 respondents‚Äîto \\\\nenable significant analysis and quantification of discrimination and violence that transgender \\\\npeople face (77).\\\\n3.2.3.

When immigration policies limit access to \\\\npublic services for immigrants and their families, these restrictions lead to spillover effects \\\\non clinical diagnoses. As one salient example, autism diagnoses for Hispanic children in \\\\nCalifornia fell following aggressive federal anti-immigrant policies requiring citizenship \\\\nverification at hospitals (78).\\\\n3.2.4. Pregnant women.‚ÄîDespite pregnancy being neither rare nor an illness, the \\\\nUnited States continues to experience rising maternal mortality and morbidity rates. In the \\\\nUnited States, the maternal mortality rate has more than doubled from 9.8 per 100,000 \\\\nlive births in 2000 to 21.5 in 2014 (79). Importantly, disclosure protocols recommend \\\\nsuppression of information in nationally available datasets when the number of cases or \\\\nevents in a data cell is low, in order to reduce the likelihood of a breach of confidentiality. \\\\nFor example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suppresses numbers for \\\\ncounties with fewer than 10 deaths for a given disease (80).

OUTCOME DEFINITION\\\\nThe next step in the model pipeline is to define the outcome of interest for a healthcare \\\\ntask. Even seemingly straightforward tasks like defining whether a patient has a disease \\\\ncan be skewed by how prevalent diseases are or how they manifest in some patient \\\\npopulations. For example, a model predicting if a patient will develop heart failure will \\\\nneed labeled examples both of patients who have heart failure and of patients without heart \\\\nfailure. Choosing these patients can rely on parts of the EHR that may be skewed due \\\\nto lack of access to care or due to abnormalities in clinical care: For example, economic \\\\nincentives may alter diagnosis code logging (81), clinical protocol affects the frequency \\\\nand observation of abnormal tests (62), historical racial mistrust may delay care and affect \\\\npatient outcomes (82), and naive data collection can yield inconsistent labels in chest X-rays \\\\n(56). Such biased labels, and the resulting models, may cause clinical practitioners to \\\\nallocate resources poorly.\\\\nDiagnosis code:\\\\na label in patient records of disease occurrence, which may be subject to \\\\nmisclassification, used primarily for billing purposes\\\\nWe discuss social justice considerations in two examples of commonly modeled healthcare \\\\noutcomes: clinical diagnosis and healthcare costs.

Clinical Diagnosis\\\\nClinical diagnosis is a fundamental task for clinical prediction models, e.g., models for \\\\ncomputer-aided diagnosis from medical imaging. In clinical settings, researchers often select \\\\npatient disease occurrence as the prediction label for models. However, there are many \\\\noptions for the choice of a disease occurrence label. For example, the outcome label for \\\\ndeveloping cardiovascular disease could be defined through the occurrence of specific \\\\nphrases in clinical notes. However, women can manifest symptoms of acute coronary \\\\nsyndrome differently (83) and receive delayed care as a result (84), which may then manifest \\\\nin diagnosis labels derived from the clinical notes being gender skewed. Because differences \\\\nin label noise result in disparities in model impact, researchers have the responsibility \\\\nto choose and improve disease labels so that these inequalities do not further exacerbate \\\\ndisparities in health.\\\\nLabel noise:\\\\nerrors or otherwise obscuring information that affects the quality of the labels\\\\nAdditionally, it is important to consider the healthcare system in which disease labels are \\\\nlogged. For example, healthcare providers leverage diagnosis codes for billing purposes, not \\\\nclinical research. As a result, diagnosis codes can create ambiguities because of overlap and \\\\nhierarchy in codes. Moreover, facilities have incentives to underreport (81) and overreport \\\\n(85, 86) outcomes, yielding differences in model representations.\\\\nRecent advances in improving disease labels target statistical corrections based on estimates \\\\nof the label noise. For instance, a positive label may be reliable, but the omission of a \\\\npositive label could indicate either a negative label (i.e., no disease) or merely a missed \\\\npositive label. Methods to address the positive-unlabeled setting use estimated noise rates \\\\n(87) or hand-curated labels from clinicians that are strongly correlated with positive labels, \\\\nknown also as silver-standard labels (88). Clinical analysis of sources of error in disease \\\\nlabels can also guide improvements (89) and identify affected groups (56).\\\\n4.2. Healthcare Costs\\\\nDevelopers of clinical models may choose to predict healthcare costs, meaning the ML \\\\nmodel seeks to predict which patients will cost the healthcare provider more in the future. \\\\nSome model developers may use healthcare costs as a proxy for future health needs to \\\\nguide accurate targeting of interventions (8), with the underlying assumption that addressing \\\\npatients with future health needs will limit future costs. Others may explicitly want to \\\\nunderstand patients who will have high healthcare costs to reduce the total cost of healthcare \\\\n(90). However, because socioeconomic factors affect both access to healthcare and access to \\\\nfinancial resources, these models may yield predictions that exacerbate inequities.\\\\nFor model developers seeking to optimize for health needs, healthcare costs can deviate \\\\nfrom health needs on an individual level because of patient socioeconomic factors. For \\\\ninstance, in a model used to allocate care management program slots to high-risk patients, \\\\nthe choice of future healthcare costs as a predictive outcome led to racial disparities in \\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 11\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\npatient allocation to the program (8). Healthcare costs can differ from health needs on an \\\\ninstitutional level due to under-insurance and undertreatment within the patient population \\\\n(91). After defining health disparities as all differences except those due to clinical need \\\\nand preferences, researchers have found racial disparities in mental healthcare. Specifically, \\\\nwhite patients had higher rates of initiation of treatment for mental health compared to \\\\nBlack and Hispanic or Latin(o/x) patients. Because the analysis controls for health needs, the \\\\ndisparities are solely a result of differences in healthcare access and systemic discrimination \\\\n(92).\\\\nAddressing issues that arise from the use of healthcare costs depends on the setting of the \\\\nML model. In cases where health need is of highest importance, a natural solution is to \\\\nchoose another outcome definition besides healthcare costs, e.g., the number of chronic \\\\ndiseases as a measure of health needs. If a model developer is most concerned with cost, it \\\\nis possible to correct for health disparities in predicting healthcare costs by building fairness \\\\nconsiderations directly into the predictive model objective function (93). Building these \\\\ntypes of algorithmic procedures is further discussed in Section 5.\\\\n5. ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT\\\\nAlgorithm development considers the construction of the underlying computation for the \\\\nML model and presents a major vulnerability and opportunity for ethical ML in healthcare. \\\\nJust as data are not neutral, algorithms are also not neutral. A disproportionate amount of \\\\npower lies with research teams that, after determining the research questions, make decisions \\\\nabout critical components of an algorithm such as the loss function (46, 94). In the case \\\\nof loss functions, common choices like the L1 absolute-error loss and L2 squared-error \\\\nloss do not target the same conditional functions of the outcome but instead minimize the \\\\nerror in the median and mean, respectively. Using a surrogate loss (e.g., hinge loss for the \\\\nerror rate) can provide computational efficiency, but it may not reflect the ethical criteria \\\\nthat we truly care about. Recent work has shown that models trained with a surrogate loss \\\\nmay exhibit approximation errors that disproportionately affect undersampled groups in \\\\nthe training data (95). Similarly, one might choose to optimize the worst-case error across \\\\ngroups as opposed to the average overall error. Such choices may seem purely technical but \\\\nreflect value statements about what should be optimized, potentially leading to differences in \\\\nperformance among marginalized groups (96).\\\\nLoss function:\\\\nthe relation that determines the error between algorithm output and a given label, which \\\\nthe algorithm uses to optimize\\\\nIn this section, we review several crucial factors in model development that potentially \\\\nimpact ethical deployment capacity: understanding (and accounting for) confounding, \\\\nfeature selection, tuning parameters, and the definition of ‚Äúfairness‚Äù itself.\\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 12\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

Understanding Confounding\\\\nDeveloping models that use sensitive attributes without a clear causal understanding of \\\\ntheir relationship to outcomes of interest can significantly affect model performance and \\\\ninterpretation. This is relevant to algorithmic problems focused on prediction, not just causal \\\\ninference. Confounding features‚Äîi.e., those features that influence both the independent \\\\nvariables and the dependent variable‚Äîrequire careful attention. The vast majority of models \\\\nlearn patterns based on observed correlations between training data, even when such \\\\ncorrelations do not occur in test data. For instance, recent work has demonstrated that \\\\nclassification models designed to detect hair color learn gender-biased decision boundaries \\\\nwhen trained on confounded data, i.e., if women are primarily blond in training data, the \\\\nmodel incorrectly associates gender with the hair label in test samples (97).\\\\nSensitive attribute:\\\\na specified patient feature (e.g., race, gender) that is considered important for fairness \\\\nconsiderations\\\\nTest data:\\\\nunseen information that a model predicts on and is evaluated against\\\\nAs ML methods are increasingly used for clinical decision support, it is critical to account \\\\nfor confounding features. In one canonical example, asthmatic patients presenting with \\\\npneumonia are given aggressive interventions that ultimately improve their chances of \\\\nsurvival over nonasthmatic patients (98). When the hospital protocol assigned additional \\\\ntreatment to patients with asthma, those patients had improved outcomes. Thus the treatment \\\\npolicy was a confounding factor in a seemingly straightforward prediction task by altering \\\\nthe data such that patients with asthma were erroneously predicted by models to have lower \\\\nrisk of dying from pneumonia.\\\\nSimply controlling for confounding features by including them as features in classification \\\\nor regression models may be insufficient to train reliable models because features can have a \\\\nmediating or moderating effect (posttreatment effect on outcomes of interest) and have to be \\\\nincorporated differently into model design (99).\\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 13\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nModern ML and causal discovery techniques can identify sources of confounding at scale \\\\n(100), although validation of such methods can be challenging because of the lack of \\\\ncounterfactual data. ML methods have also been proposed to estimate causal effects from \\\\nobservational data (101, 102). In practice, when potential hidden confounding is suspected, \\\\neither mediating features or proxies can be leveraged (99, 103) or sensitivity analysis \\\\nmethods can be used to determine potential sources of errors in effect estimates (104). \\\\nData-augmentation and sampling methods may also be used to mitigate effects of model \\\\nconfounding. For example, augmenting X-ray images with rotated and translated variants \\\\ncan help train a model that is not sensitive to orientation of an image (105).\\\\n5.2. Feature Selection\\\\nWith large-scale digitization of EHRs and other sources, sensitive attributes like race \\\\nand ethnicity may be increasingly available (although prone to misclassification and \\\\nmissingness). However, blindly incorporating factors like race and gender in a predictive \\\\nmodel may exacerbate inequities for a wide range of diagnostics and treatments (106). These \\\\nresulting inequities can lead to unintended and permanent embedding of biases in algorithms \\\\nused for clinical care. For example, vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) scores are used to \\\\npredict success of trial of labor of pregnant women with a prior cesarean section; however, \\\\nthese scores explicitly include a race component as an input, which reduces the chance of \\\\nVBAC success for Black and Hispanic women. Although researchers found that previous \\\\nobservational studies showed correlation between racial identity and success of trial of labor \\\\n(107), the underlying cause of this association is not well understood. Such naive inclusion \\\\nof race information could exacerbate disparities in maternal mortality. This ambiguity calls \\\\ninto question race-based correction in scores like VBAC (106).\\\\nAutomation in feature selection does not eliminate the need for contextual understanding. \\\\nFor example, stepwise regression is commonly used and taught as a technique for feature \\\\nselection despite known limitations (108). While specific methods have varying initialization \\\\n(e.g., start with an empty set of features or a full set of features) and processing steps \\\\n(e.g., deletion versus addition of features), most rely on p-values, R2, or other global fit \\\\nmetrics to select features. Weaknesses of stepwise regressions include the misleading nature \\\\nof p-values and the fact that the final set depends on if and when features were considered \\\\n(109). In ML, penalized regressions like lasso regression are popular for automated feature \\\\nselection, but the lasso trades potential increases in estimation bias for reductions in \\\\nvariance by shrinking some feature coefficients to zero. Features selected by lasso may \\\\nbe colinear with other features not selected (110). Over-interpretation of the selected features \\\\nin any automated procedures should therefore be avoided in practice given these pitfalls. \\\\nResearchers should also consider the humans-in-the-loop framework, whereby incorporation \\\\nof automated procedures is blended with investigator knowledge (111).\\\\nStepwise regression:\\\\na method of estimation whereby each feature is sequentially considered by addition or \\\\nsubtraction to the existing feature set\\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 14\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

Tuning Parameters\\\\nThere are many tuning parameters that may be set a priori or selected via cross-validation \\\\n(110). These range from the learning rate in a neural network to the minimum size of \\\\nthe terminal leaves in a random forest. In the latter example, default settings in R for \\\\nclassification will allow trees to grow until there is just one observation in a terminal leaf. \\\\nThis can lead to overfitting the model to the training data and a loss of generalizability to \\\\nthe target population. Lack of generalizability is a central concern for ethical ML given the \\\\npreviously discussed issues in data collection and study inclusion. When data lack diversity \\\\nand are not representative of the target population where the model would be deployed, \\\\noverfitting algorithms to this data has the potential to disproportionately harm marginalized \\\\ngroups (112). Using cross-validation to select tuning parameters does not automatically \\\\nsolve these problems, as cross-validation still operates with respect to an a priori‚Äìchosen \\\\noptimization target.\\\\nGeneralizability:\\\\nthe ability of a model to apply in a setting different from the one in which it was trained\\\\n5.4. Performance Metrics\\\\nThere are many commonly used performance metrics for model evaluation, such as area \\\\nunder the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), area under the precision-recall \\\\ncurve (AUPRC), and calibration (113). However, the appropriate metrics to optimize depend \\\\non the intended use case and relative value of true positives, false positives, true negatives, \\\\nand false negatives. Not only can AUC be misleading when considering other global fit \\\\nmetrics (e.g., high AUC masking a weak true positive rate) but it also does not describe the \\\\nimpact of the model across selected groups. Furthermore, even so-called objective metrics \\\\nand scores can be deeply flawed and lead to over- or undertreatment of minorities if blindly \\\\napplied (114). Note that robust reporting of results should include an explicit statement of \\\\nother nonoptimized metrics, including the original intended use case, the training cohort and \\\\ncase, or the level of model uncertainty.\\\\nPerformance metric:\\\\nscore or other quantitative representation of a model‚Äôs quality and ability to achieve goals\\\\nAUC:\\\\na measure of the sensitivity and specificity of a model for each decision threshold\\\\nAUPRC:\\\\na measure of precision and recall of a model for each decision threshold\\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 15\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

Group Fairness Definition\\\\nThe specific definition of fairness for a given application often impacts the choice of a \\\\nloss function, and therefore the underlying algorithm. Individual fairness imposes classifier \\\\nperformance requirements that operate over pairs of individuals; e.g., similar individuals \\\\nshould be treated similarly (115). Group fairness operates over protected groups (based on \\\\nsome sensitive attribute) by requiring that a classifier performance metric be balanced across \\\\nthose groups (116, 117). For instance, a model may be partially assessed by calculating \\\\nthe true positive rate separately among rural and urban populations to ensure risk score \\\\nsimilarity. Regressions subject to group fairness constraints or penalties optimizing toward \\\\njoint global and group fit considerations have also been developed (93, 118, 119).\\\\nGroup fairness:\\\\na principle whereby predefined patient groups should receive similar model performance\\\\nRecent work has focused on identifying and mitigating violations of fairness definitions \\\\nin healthcare settings. While most of these algorithms have emerged outside the field of \\\\nhealthcare, researchers have designed penalized and constrained regressions to improve \\\\nthe performance of health insurance plan payment. This payment system impacts tens \\\\nof millions of lives in the United States and is known to undercompensate insurers \\\\nfor individuals with certain health conditions, including mental health and substance \\\\nuse disorders, in part because billing codes do not accurately capture diagnoses \\\\n(120). Undercompensation creates incentives for insurers exclude individuals with these \\\\nhealth conditions from enrollment, limiting their access to care. Regressions subject \\\\nto group fairness constraints or penalties have been successful in removing nearly all \\\\nundercompensation for a single group with negligible impacts on global fit (93). Subsequent \\\\nwork incorporating multiple groups into the loss function also saw improvements in \\\\nundercompensation for the majority of groups not included (121).\\\\n6. POSTDEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS\\\\nOften the goal of model training is to ultimately deploy it in a clinical, epidemiological, \\\\nor policy service. However, deployed models can have lasting ethical impact beyond the \\\\nmodel performance measured in development: For example, in the inclusion of race in the \\\\nclinical risk scores described above that may lead to chronic over- or undertreatment (106). \\\\nHere we outline considerations for robust deployment by highlighting the need for careful \\\\nperformance reporting and auditing generalizability, documentation, and regulation.\\\\n6.1. Quantifying Impact\\\\nUnlike in other settings with high-stakes decisions (e.g., aviation), clinical staff performance \\\\nis not audited by an external body (122). Instead, clinicians are often a self-governing body, \\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 16\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nrelying on clinicians themselves to determine when a colleague is underperforming or in \\\\nbreach of ethical practice principles, e.g., through such tools as surgical morbidity and \\\\nmortality conferences (123). Clinical staff can also struggle to keep abreast of what current \\\\nbest practice recommendations are, as these can change dramatically over time; one study \\\\nfound that more than 400 previously routine practices were later contradicted in leading \\\\nclinical journals (124).\\\\nHence, it is important to measure and address the downstream impact of models \\\\nthough audits for bias and examination of clinical impact (6). Regular model auditing \\\\npostdeployment, i.e., detailed inspection of model performance on various groups and \\\\noutcomes, may reveal the impact of models on different populations (8) and identify areas \\\\nof potential concern. Some recent work has targeted causal models in dynamic systems in \\\\norder to reduce the severity of bias (125). Others have targeted bias reduction through model \\\\nconstruction with explicit guarantees about balanced performance (16) or by specifying \\\\ngroups that must have equal performance (126). Additionally, there is the possibility that \\\\nmodels may help to debias current clinical care by reducing known biases against minorities \\\\n(127) and disadvantaged majorities (128).\\\\nModel auditing:\\\\nthe postdeployment inspection of model performance on groups and outcomes\\\\n6.2. Model Generalizability\\\\nAs has been raised in previous sections, a crucial concern with model deployment is \\\\ngeneralization. Any shifts in data distributions can significantly impact model performance \\\\nwhen the settings for development and for deployment differ. For example, chest X-ray \\\\ndiagnosis models can have high performance on test data drawn from the same hospital \\\\nbut degrade rapidly on data from another hospital (129). Other work in gender bias on \\\\nchest X-ray data has demonstrated both that small proportions of female chest X-rays \\\\ndegrade diagnostic performance accuracy in female patients (130) and that this is not simply \\\\naddressed in all cases by adding in more female X-rays (131). Even within a single hospital, \\\\nmodels trained on data from an initial EHR system data deteriorated significantly when \\\\ntested on data from a new EHR system (132). Finally, data artifacts that induce strong priors \\\\nin what patterns ML models are sensitive to have the potential to perpetrate harms when \\\\nused without awareness (133). For example, patients with dark skin can have morphological \\\\nvariation and disease manifestations that are not easily detected under the defaults that are \\\\nset by predominantly white-skinned patients (134).\\\\nData artifact:\\\\na flaw in data caused by equipment, techniques, or conditions that is unrelated to model \\\\noutput\\\\nSeveral algorithms have recently been proposed to account for distribution shifts in \\\\ndata (135, 136). However, these algorithms have significant limitations, as they typically \\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 17\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 July 01.\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nAuthor Manuscript\\\\nrequire assumptions about the nature or amount of distributional shift an algorithm can \\\\naccommodate. Some, like that of Reference 136, may require a clear indication of which \\\\ndistributions in a healthcare pipeline are expected to change, and may develop models for \\\\nprediction accordingly. Many of these assumptions may be verifiable. If not, periodically \\\\nmonitoring for data shifts (137) and potentially retraining models when performance \\\\ndeteriorates due to such shifts are imperative deployment considerations with significant \\\\nethical implications.\\\\n6.3. Model and Data Documentation\\\\nClear documentation enables insight into the model development and data collection. Good \\\\nmodel documentation should include clinically specific features of model development that \\\\ncan be assessed and recorded beforehand, such as logistics within the clinical setting, \\\\npotential unintended consequences, and trade-offs between bias and performance (138). In \\\\naddition to raising ethical concerns in the pipeline, the process of co-designing checklists \\\\nwith clinical practitioners formalizes ad hoc procedures and empowers individual advocates \\\\n(139). Standardized reporting of model performance‚Äîsuch as the one-page summary model \\\\ncards for model reporting (140)‚Äîcan empower clinical practitioners to understand model \\\\nlimitations and future model developers to identify areas of improvement. Similarly, better \\\\ndocumentation of the data supporting initial model training can help expose sources of \\\\ndiscrimination in the collected data. Modelers could use datasheets for datasets to detail the \\\\nconditions of data collection (141).\\\\n6.4. Regulation\\\\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) bears responsibility for the \\\\nregulation of healthcare ML models. As there does not exist comprehensive guidance for \\\\nhealthcare model research and subsequent deployment, the opportunity is ripe to create \\\\na comprehensive framework to audit and regulate models. Currently, the FDA‚Äôs proposed \\\\nML-specific modifications to the software as a medical device regulations draw a distinction \\\\nbetween models that are trained and then frozen prior to clinical deployment and models that \\\\ncontinue to learn on observed outcomes. Although models in the latter class can leverage \\\\nlarger, updated datasets, they also face additional risk due to model drift and may need \\\\nadditional audits (142). Such frameworks should explicitly account for health disparities \\\\nacross the stages of ML development in health and ensure health equity audits as part of \\\\npostmarket evaluation (143). We also note that there are many potential legal implications, \\\\ne.g., in malpractice and liability suits, that will require new solutions (144).\\\\nResearchers have proposed additional frameworks to guide clinical model development, \\\\nwhich could inspire future regulation. ML model regulation could draw from existing \\\\nregulatory frameworks: An RCT for ML models would assess patient benefit compared \\\\nto a control cohort of standard clinical practice (145), and a drug development pipeline for \\\\nML models would define a protocol for adverse events and model recalls (146). The clinical \\\\ninterventions accompanying the clinical ML model should be analyzed to contextualize the \\\\nuse of the model in the clinical setting (147).\\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 18\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

RECOMMENDATIONS\\\\nIn this review, we have described the ethical considerations at each step of the ML model \\\\ndevelopment pipeline we introduced. While most researchers will address known challenges \\\\nsuch as deployed task accuracy and outcome distribution shift, they are unlikely to be aware \\\\nof the full magnitude of the hidden challenges such as existing health inequities or outcome \\\\nlabel bias. As seen in Figure 2, many hidden pipeline challenges can go unaddressed in a \\\\ntypical ML health project, but they have serious ethical repercussions. With these challenges \\\\nin mind, we propose five general recommendations that span the pipeline stages:\\\\n1.\\\\nProblems should be tackled by diverse teams and using frameworks that increase \\\\nthe probability that equity will be achieved. Further, historically understudied \\\\nproblems are important targets to practitioners looking to perform high-impact \\\\nwork.\\\\n2.\\\\nData collection should be framed as an important front-of-mind concern in \\\\nthe ML modeling pipeline, clear disclosures should be made about imbalanced \\\\ndatasets, and researchers should engage with domain experts to ensure that data \\\\nreflecting the needs of underserved and understudied populations are gathered.\\\\n3.\\\\nOutcome choice should reflect the task at hand and should preferably be \\\\nunbiased. If the outcome label has ethical bias, the source of inequity should be \\\\naccounted for in ML model design, leveraging literature that attempts to remove \\\\nethical biases during preprocessing, or with use of a reasonable proxy.\\\\n4.\\\\nReflection on the goals of the model is essential during development and should \\\\nbe articulated in a preanalysis plan. In addition to technical choices like loss \\\\nfunction, researchers must interrogate how, and whether, a model should be \\\\ndeveloped to best answer a research question, as well as what caveats are \\\\nincluded.\\\\n5.\\\\nAudits should be designed to identify specific harms and should be paired with \\\\nmethods and procedures. Harms should be examined group by group, rather \\\\nthan at a population level. ML ethical design checklists are one possible tool to \\\\nsystematically enumerate and consider such ethical concerns prior to declaring \\\\nsuccess in a project.\\\\nFinally, we note that ML also could and should be harnessed to create shifts in power \\\\nin health-care systems (148). This might mean actively selecting problems for the benefit \\\\nof underserved patients, designing methods to target systemic interventions for improved \\\\naccess to care and treatments, or enforcing evaluations with the explicit purpose of \\\\npreserving patient autonomy. In one salient example, the state of California reduced \\\\ndisparities in rates of obstetric hemorrhage (and therefore maternal mortality for women \\\\nof color) by weighing blood loss sponges, i.e., making access to treatment consistent and \\\\nunbiased for all women (149). Models could similarly be harnessed to learn and recommend \\\\nconsistent rules, potentially giving researchers an opportunity to debias current clinical \\\\ncare (150), measure racial disparities and mistrust in end-of-life care (82), and improve \\\\nknown biases against minorities (127) and disadvantaged majorities (128). Ultimately, \\\\nthe responsibility for ethical models and behavior lies with a broad community, but it \\\\nChen et al.\\\\nPage 19\\\\nAnnu Rev Biomed Data Sci.

      "## Abstract\n",
      "This study investigates the effects of Drug X on patients with heart disease. The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy, safety, and potential side effects of the drug. This research involved a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a sample size of 300 patients diagnosed with heart disease. The study was conducted over a period of 12 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "Heart disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current treatments focus on managing symptoms and slowing disease progression. Drug X, a novel pharmaceutical compound, has shown promise in preclinical trials. This study aims to evaluate its effectiveness in a clinical setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "### Study Design\n",
      "- **Type of Study:** Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)\n",
      "- **Duration:** 12 months\n",
      "- **Sample Size:** 300 patients\n",
      "- **Inclusion Criteria:** Patients diagnosed with heart disease, aged between 40-75 years, and able to provide informed consent.\n",
      "- **Exclusion Criteria:** Patients with a history of allergic reactions to the components of Drug X, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and those with concurrent severe illnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Intervention\n",
      "Participants were randomly assigned to the treatment group (Drug X) or the control group (placebo). The treatment group received Drug X at a dosage of 50 mg daily, while the control group received a matching placebo.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Data Collection\n",
      "Data was collected at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. The primary outcomes were measured using:\n",

      "\n",
      "## Discussion\n",
      "Drug X demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in several key indicators of heart disease, including heart function, cholesterol levels, and inflammatory markers. The reduction in arrhythmia incidence suggests that Drug X may offer additional benefits in maintaining cardiac rhythm. However, a noteworthy percentage of participants experienced minor side effects, which warrants further investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths\n",
      "- **Randomized Controlled Design:** Minimizes bias and establishes a cause-effect relationship.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Limitations\n",
      "- **Sample Size:** Although adequate, a larger sample size could provide more definitive conclusions.\n",
      "- **Duration:** Long-term effects and safety profile need further assessment over a more extended period.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "Drug X shows promise as a therapeutic option for patients with heart disease, with significant improvements in heart function and associated biomarkers. Future studies should focus on larger populations and aim to address the long-term safety and efficacy of the drug.\n",
